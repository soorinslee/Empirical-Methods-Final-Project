Back in the 80\u2019s on the river in Cambridge, as the punt in front of us stopped under a bridge, a girl got up from the stern and sang Jerusalem. Phenomenal acoustics. It was a golden moment that still transports me to another world.",

Please share more cool vocal and choral music on this channel (and if you want some pointers, get in touch \ud83d\ude03). Parry is considered to have had an impact on Elgar's music, and he also taught Holst and Vaughan Williams! He has a lot of really great vocal and church music.\n\n2) Sibelius' Sapin is part of a collection (op.75) of five short piano pieces. Sibelius did indeed write stuff like this basically to make money, and didn't care too much for the piano. The piece is really nice though, and the other ones in the opus are interesting too!\n\nPlease keep making more videos like this Twoset!",
