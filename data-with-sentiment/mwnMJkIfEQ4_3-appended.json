Remember when one of his first requests upon being sworn in was to ask for a back channel communication to the Russians?  And then he rammed through Jared Kushner's security clearance even though it was officially denied due to security concerns.  Remember that?\n\nAnd eventually we will find that Trump is in hock to the Russians and that's the main reason he wants (needs) to be President.  I suspect the deal that Trump has fashioned is that if he is dutifully \"useful\" to them, they will forgive the debts.  I shudder to think how much classified information he has already shared with them.\n\nWe could spend the rest of this century chasing down all the corruption Trump has committed as both a private citizen and as President...and we still probably wouldn't get through all of it.",
