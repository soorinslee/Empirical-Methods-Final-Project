My 2nd was a SW:Legion Prime tournament in which I brought an illegal list because I was still a noob list builder. That seems to be my largest failing; making a competitive army to play with.",

When people play with their friends or random strangers are clubs, they're often just playing for fun. I remember when I was young and we played magic the gathering in high school. This was back when magic  was very very young. It was really fun, until I got to college, it was fun for a bit there too, but then everyone starting to get into fine tuned 2 turn stomp decks for competitive play. Gone were massive crazy theme fun decks. Playing became less about playing and more about your stats and you could see their disappointed when they didn't get the starting hand they wanted, and their minds would immediately go to tweaking the deck rather than enjoying the game in front of them.",

There was something about that game that really brought out the sweaty tryhards in my area. I'm currently into Marvel Crisis Protocol which has a much more casual vibe, so I'd like to try a tournament for that if I ever get the chance.",
