I took my turn with ADG as my only sent as a teenager in the late 1990s-early 2000s. I'm pretty new to collecting and have been thinking about getting my nostalgia fragrances from those times including ADG, Polo Sport, Curve, and the original Hugo Boss canteen bottle, but you give me too many other suggestions that I buy instead! I would love to win this for the nostalgia.",
