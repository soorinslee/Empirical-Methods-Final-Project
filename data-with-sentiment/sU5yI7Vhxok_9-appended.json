I must say, I enjoyed your version much better \ud83d\ude0a and thank you for the warning at the beginning of your video. I'm sure the video is amazing, since you all sang so wonderfully!! However, blinking lights can bring on a vertigo attack (lol I don't even get those right. Instead of the room \"constantly spinning\" mine rocks. Like I'm on a rocking horse and I can't get off. And it can last anywhere from a few minutes to a month.) Anyways, can't wait to hear more of your music! So glad I'm a subscriber \ud83e\udd70",
