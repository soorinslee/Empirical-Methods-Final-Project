It struck me because where I live in Colombia, I can get cardamom so easily and its so cheap! However I would agree with the video as only about 30% of the cardamom I normally get, meets the criteria (big, green and closed) that the market demands. \n\nPro tip: Cardamom is such a great vegan substitute for chewing gum. It\u2019s freshness leaves a hit of sweet mint to the breath!",
