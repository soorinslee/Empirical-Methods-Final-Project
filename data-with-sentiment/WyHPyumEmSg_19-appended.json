Fly; It's just Bird Dig. Protect; It's just the first turn of Dig. Earthquake; It's just the second part of Dig. Flamethrower; It's just the second part of Dig, but fire type. Swords Dance; The first turn of Dig, but it raises your Attack, but to balance it out you can still get hit. What about Splash though? It's just like not using Dig.\"\nVery Enjoyable.",
