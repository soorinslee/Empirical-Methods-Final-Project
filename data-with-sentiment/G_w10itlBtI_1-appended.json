Having it tucked into the corner is a much better use of an area that could be awkward. Having it slide out over the counter will ensure that you don\u2019t have clutter on your counter top. I\u2019m a big fan of keeping things off counters. Easier to clean, better looking space. Also loving that cabinet making set up. You make it look easy, though I\u2019m sure that equipment and software wasn\u2019t cheap.",

If it's not, it's going to draw a ton of attention.\n- You can open drawers/doors with one motion instead of pushing on it and then opening the cabinet/drawer manually.\n\nThe only reason for push to open that I can think of is that if you manage to break a pull or want to expand the kitchen without tearing down everything else, you may be in a situation where manufacturer stopped producing that specific pull and you either have to try to match a different pull or replace all of them. With push to open it's not really a problem.\n\nA side note: Anything sliding over the counter top (talking about the slide out pantry) may become a pain in the butt when you have lots of stuff on the counter top and need to move it just to get something from the pantry.",
