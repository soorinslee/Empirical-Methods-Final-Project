Most of the Democrats and the Republicans living large and in-charge are part of the globalist ideology and establishment.\n\n&gt; Whether donkey or elephant, both sides are beholden to their banking and corporate masters. Mere platitudes and lip service are given to \u2018we the people\u2019. Commoners like you and I are seen as pawns in the big globalist game.\n\n&gt; Look no further than Rino Ryan for a case study in special interest control. He fakes conservatism when convenient for political points, yet fails time and again to back up American citizens.\n\nIf Ben's trying to bring himself back to his old [pre-Trump\u00ader self](https://thenib.com/the-internet-s-most-trolled-cartoonist-91a92d9b7585/), then maybe he should try to not have an ad for a 2022 Trump calendar and a \"Le\u00adt's G\u00ado Bra\u00adndon\" mug on the same page, hm? Along with the other newer cartoons on the front page with this one that are [praising Cruz, slamming Garland](https://grrrgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ted_cruz_merrick_garland.jpg), and pushing [Trump-tier bullshit about Biden and Fauci](https://grrrgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jab_and_sniff_children-tina-toon.jpg)...",
