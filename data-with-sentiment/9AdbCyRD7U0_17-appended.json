He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, \u2018God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\u2019\r\n\r\n14 \u201cI tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\u201d",

With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord\u2019s people.",
