I started playing 40k with friends back in 2020, but recently fell in love with the x-wing mini game (I think I\u2019ve played 20ish games in the past month I\u2019ve been playing) as I ended up trying it at my LGS. \n\nI was lucky that everyone I\u2019ve met so far has been super friendly in the local league, and totally willing to lend me a unit or card to try a combo out. I ended up going 2-2 which I was super happy with, as even in my losses I learned a significant amount. I met a bunch of cool people and learned about some more unique combos. I didn\u2019t really expect to ever play tournament style but I honestly would recommend it to everyone at least once!",

I definitely saw some ugly unbeatable lists there, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed just playing the game for two days straight. All of my opponents were cool guys that were great to play against. I managed to get a best painted award as well as a first place overall due to some very lucky pairings (I was lucky enough not to play against White Scars - Thunderwolf Cavalry - Biker Librarian invisibility list, for those whe remember the dark days of 40k tournament scene) \n\nI'm actually going to my second big tournament with 100+ players next week, playing Nagash in Ossiarch army, looking forward to the event! For me it was a great way to push myself to paint said Nagash that I was putting off for so long, since the event I'm attending is a fully painted armies only event.",

Always had fun, but the most memorable had to be a 40k tournament at our FLGS. A friend and I decided to take identical armies, so after perusing our collections we decided on Eldar. I wrote up a backstory about twin farseers and made it general enough that it could go with either twin. We even wore matching GW t-shirts. The funniest thing that happened was that we played each other's first round opponents in the second round. Their dawning realization as we placed units was priceless! He went 3-0, while I got 1-2. I guess our lists matched his play style better. All in all it was a great experience!",
