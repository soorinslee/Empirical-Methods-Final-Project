I work my AZZ off, pay her rent, put her in a newer car that I pay for, she got pissed off one day and stopped speaking to me.she never communicates when something is wrong, just shuts down. Now I'm to the point where IDGAF, she can keep her house and 20 year old lazy child that runs the home. I never had any say so, every time I say something about her kid, it's the end of the world. Now I just want to be left alone and focus on me, I'd rather be single and happy than deal with bullchit EVER again.",
