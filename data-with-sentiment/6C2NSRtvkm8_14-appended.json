I was complaining about some of the gun stuff in the game to my girlfriend, and told her \"There are 20 round mags for M16s. But the model has a 30 rounder, and 30 rounds would give you a proper amount of bursts\". I get that its for some balancing reason, but if they insist on not giving the M16 30 rounds, could they maybe at least do 21 for a full set of bursts, and change the mag model?",
