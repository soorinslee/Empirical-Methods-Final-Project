I want to get it, but really want to hear your thoughts first \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09 as always, watching your videos is like a warm Emily hug. You always give me a sweet start to my day. P.s. loved seeing your family dressed up for Halloween. I miss the days when my kiddos went trick or treating. But now that I\u2019m a Grammy, I\u2019ll get to see my grandson trick or treat. Can\u2019t wait for that! Big hugs, Brenda",
