With the current population and the exponential growth I see either a bigger divide between rich and poor or a necessary drastic dying off of population.  Everyone complains about fossil fuel use but fail to mention that current renewable energy is completely incapable of replacing it.  On top of that you have the vast majority of climate activists telling other people to stop but they are unwilling to change their behaviors.",
