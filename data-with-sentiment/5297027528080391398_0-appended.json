I used to do this for a company that I left eventually, but I had the means to do so (mainly, no children).\n\nWhat really helped me was to think of myself as a product when it comes to work. I am paid to handle certain problems and make sure certain tasks are completed. How many hours I spend doing that is my own business. You wouldn't buy a product then return it when you found out that it didn't take as long to make as you thought it would. The product either works or it doesn't.\n\nThis is certainly easier for some professions than others (this really helps for remote work), but it is something to keep in mind when looking for new jobs or if you ever feel guilty for \"not working enough\". If you're working over 40 hours to get the things that need to be done completed, your company is basically just being cheap because they need more employees on that task. If that's the case, it is probably best to look for a new job because them overworking you is likely by design. Things usually don't \"calm down\" or \"go back to normal\" because the overworking is normal for them.",
