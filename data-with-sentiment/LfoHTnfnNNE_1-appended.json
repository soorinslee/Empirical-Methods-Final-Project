Anyway, if one is at least half objective then one knows that this tory government is full of incompetence and the only thing they somewhat can do is antagonize.

Would love to see those gammon faces dealing with that \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd7a\u2639\ud83e\udd7a  \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23\nBtw can't wait for next year when the only industry here in the UK - financial services - won't be granted equivalency and more money leaves London and even less pennies will reach those desperate gammons who have been eating up the lies and half truths of the right wing tabloids and now believing that their misery is somehow the EU's fault, and that there is no efing way this lot in charge will come anywhere near of the financial support EU was giving them. So much more to say but, in the spirit of ancient/medieval which most of you love, it would be like pearls to swine. Cheerios",
