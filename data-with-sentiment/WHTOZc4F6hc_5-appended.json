Gun safety is the first thing one needs to learn, just like any other tool. Gun control laws breed irresponsible gun ownership, instead of a healthy respect for the tool. \n\nNo responsible person would ever draw his weapon, with such disregard for his surroundings. We need heavy penalties for illegal gun ownership and more education on gun safety. This is America people. You're not getting rid of guns. Villfying them does nothing but increase crime. \n\nHAVE WE NOT LEARNED ANYTHING FROM PROHIBITION????",
