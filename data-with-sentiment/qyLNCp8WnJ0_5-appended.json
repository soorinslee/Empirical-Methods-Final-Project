Florida had approx 13,000 Covid cases in the last week and about 870 deaths. My 90 yr old father recently moved there and I am worried about him living there. I'm afraid to go visit.  So, how can you feel safe not wearing a mask?",

The skin and smoke flavoring is repulsive so I'll stick with Costco's normally stocked sardines that are skinless and flavored only with salt -- these I buy by the case.
