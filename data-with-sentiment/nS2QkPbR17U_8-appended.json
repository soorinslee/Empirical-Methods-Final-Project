I did and it helped me get a start, but you have to get style inspiration from anyone or thing you like. Experiment with fit, wear baggy clothes, wear fit clothes, wear some crazy shit that nobody would rock because that is what fashion is about. Use these type of videos as a gateway drug into style,  but don\u2019t only get everything from YouTuber like Aaron.",
