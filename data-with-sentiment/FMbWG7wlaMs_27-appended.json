I love you and adore everything you do and how hard you've worked is so inspiring, but these house tour videos are so vapid and soulless. You have NOTHING on display that makes me think you like the nerdy fun stuff you make videos about, Dnd, video games, anything. It's so sterile and uncomfortable. Gorgeous, sure, but you like.. didnt even share a single music record. THE ONE thing in this video I felt would have been -you-\n\nI hope the next tour videos shows some side of you that feel personable. I wanna know if you collect anything fun and dorky.",
