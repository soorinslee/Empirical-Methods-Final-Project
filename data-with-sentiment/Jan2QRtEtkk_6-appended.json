So as to make light and humor of someone\u2019s error.\nSo where has compassion disappeared to?  It like the educational system is teaching the newer generation to \u2018show no concern\u2019 -except for yourself!  Focus on your own needs, others are questionable\u2026 don\u2019t trust the strangers\u2026 because you never know if they are an enemy!\nSo is love, kindness, compassion but as characteristic of the past?  Do these have any value?  Or are they just old-fashioned elements of history which are become \u2018archaic\u2019.\nBut then observe how democrats are handling issues\u2026 I think it\u2019s near time for a different nature of intervention.",
