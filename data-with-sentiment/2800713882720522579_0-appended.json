Coverage that suits the situation.\n\nMost insurers will cover major events anyway (to varying degrees), so the real value is in the fine print.\n\n\n\nEg. You drop a bottle and break a tile on the floor of your shower recess*-\n\n\nInsurer A: \"We will cover the min cost of a tiler (4hrs), and an allowance to find a matching tile ($50), but we can't guarantee a watertight repair,  so we will be cash settling for the above price.\"\n\nInsurer B: \"We have a policy that allows $1500 towards matching materials. We will also allow 4hrs for a tiler.\nWe will cash settle as above.\"\n\nInsurer C: \"Fuck. Let's find you a motel while we replace your entire bathroom, and provide a warranty for all works undertaken.\"\n\n\n*Dependant on relevant building codes and existing construction methods.\n\n\n \nInsurer A, B and C can be in very similar price brackets, so an instant saving should not be the only criteria when shopping.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.",

This are not going to end well for you, whoever you use.\n\nI have criteria for companies I use that far exceed base cost.  My government are always on about moving my ISP, utilities, insurance, etc. on comparison sites.\n\nIn the UK, the cheapest gas companies all just went bust, pushing their customers onto higher prices because they don't have a sustainable business model once energy prices start to rise.  That's a ton of hassle, and because of complete lack of investment in their services.\n\nI want a company that supplies what I want, fucks off, leaves me alone, stays around for a long time and doesn't go trying to con me.  That usually means NOT the cheapest company at all.\n\nI'm far from being a capitalist, I'm a no-hassleist.  My only ISP is actually a 4G stick that I manage myself and change SIMs if people don't perform.  I've changed once in 4 years, and not to the cheapest company - and that was because the company failed to inform me that they had better deals that I could be put onto with them, they tried to profit from my loyalty.  So rather than go to the cheaper package with them, I paid more and moved to a far more up-front and honest company.\n\nMy car insurance I change almost every year because it rises for absolutely no reason - I've had no accidents and other companies will insure me cheaper.  But I have a blacklist of insurance companies who will always give me cheaper insurance, but who I refuse to use.\n\nLoyalty isn't rewarded to customers.  Don't think it ever is.  But a company's loyalty to me is rewarded - I stay being a customer and will pay more for an equivalent service than I would pay their competitors.\n\nBasically:  Don't spam me, don't raise prices, don't change the deal (unless it's for the better), don't skimp on services, don't try to profiteer.\n\nI actually like companies without in-person or on-the-telephone customer service.  They seem to work so much better.  And companies that DON'T contact me with random sales material.\n\nYou've got a new cheaper deal for existing customers?  Great, why do I need to \"switch\" to it?  That means the deal is different.  Just lower my price automatically and then tell me that.  I'll be over the moon about that.  Or give me more for my money and tell me that.\n\nThat's how almost all the companies I use work, and I'm loyal to them because of it.\n\nAnd hardly any company I use is the \"cheapest\".",

So you think, fuck it, it's cheaper so I might as well. 6 months later, your renewal rate is $150 per month. What the hell? That's a huge increase. It is what it is, they say, rates change over time (this is true). Well, you say, I'm going back to company A, they only charged me $100 per month with only small fluctuations each term. You get a quote from company A for $180 per month. Guess what? Now you've only been with your company for a single term, which is usually 6 months. You're not a good customer anymore, so you don't get the best rate.  \n\ntldr: Only switch insurance companies if the savings are significant.

A lot of companies will also give accident forgiveness around the 10 year mark. Which could save you a lot of money in the long run. \nYou just never know when rates will go up or down. They depend on you a lot as an individual. \nPeople are rated on what\u2019s called the CRI or Customer Rating Index. Credit score, loans, driving history, time being licensed, etc. \nIt\u2019s worth shopping around but being loyal to a company can pay out big in the long run. \nIt\u2019s a cost analysis for each person as an individual. There are different insurance companies for everyone. Some have better pricing for people with accidents and tickets.",

            "body": "This isn't bad advice per se, but there are 2 important things to remember. 1, many insurance companies give a discount to new customers in an effort to entice you to leave your current company, but then your rate could increase significantly at your first renewal. 2, many insurance companies give you a lower rate based on how long you were with your previous company. The idea is, if you were a loyal customer with your previous company for a long time, maybe you'll be loyal to this company too; and also, again, to entice you to switch companies.  \n\nSo here's an example scenario. Let's say your rate with company A is $100 per month and you've been with them for 5 years. Company B offers you $90 per month. So you think, fuck it, it's cheaper so I might as well. 6 months later, your renewal rate is $150 per month. What the hell? That's a huge increase. It is what it is, they say, rates change over time (this is true). Well, you say, I'm going back to company A, they only charged me $100 per month with only small fluctuations each term. You get a quote from company A for $180 per month. Guess what? Now you've only been with your company for a single term, which is usually 6 months. You're not a good customer anymore, so you don't get the best rate.  \n\ntldr: Only switch insurance companies if the savings are significant. You could save money in the short term and screw yourself in the long term.",
