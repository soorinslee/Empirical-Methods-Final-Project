It may seem like China and India are the ultimate culprits who cause climate change, but when you add the historical emissions since the industrial revolution, they aren't the culprits, it's the western developed countries. Since the industrial revolution India has barely contribution 3% to world CO2 emissions while accounting for 17% of the world population, where as US has contributed 23% CO2 emissions with just 4% of the world population, and that's without considering the CO2 for imported products from Asia. The west first industrialized itself and polluted the climate, and then outsourced all manufacturing(which means even the CO2 emissions) to Asia in late 20th century, what happens is that China becomes the largest CO2 emitter, but that's obvious because it's literally producing everything for the world.  Its as though the western population got our products and we got their pollution and in the future Asian countries will even get the blame for climate change while the west  must be accountable for climate change if you see total historical emission.\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude11 The original 1995 Agreement was that the western developed countries would reduce their net emission to zero which would give developing countries \"the room\" to emit more, develop quickly and switch to greener methods. But the western countries never got their emissions down and developing countries started emitting more which just boosted climate change at the end of the day \ud83d\ude2d",
