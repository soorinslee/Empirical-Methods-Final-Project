If they will participate in reverse internships by offering salaries for no work until workers decide they feel like working, I'm sure they can trust workers to eventually appreciate the value of those salaries, just as employers have always appreciate the value of interns' skills and always eventually hired them for pay, and workers will inevitably choose to work for the money.

I had only 4 hours of my life in which I was awake and not at work. And 2horus of it will be dedicated to eating , and household chores . Therefore my life (personal life) only had a total of 2 whole hrs a day to waste in which I couldn't decide what to do. I have a similar job offer now after 7 months. SHould I take it?",
