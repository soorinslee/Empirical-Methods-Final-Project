Sorry but no one enlightened me how those scars should be look at. How and why those scars where there. After I had my girl I have this massive battlescars all over my tummy. I used to cry at night looking back how I see myself, how horrible I look and feel. But everytime I look at my child, I understand why I have this, why it shouldn't be ashamed of, why it should be normalised. Let us be the one to educate our children that this won't make her/him less beautiful. In the first place your genetics is a big factor. Even those Super Models have their own stretch marks. \ud83d\udc9a",

They are DIFFERENT things. \u203c\ufe0f\n\nHow mothers do to their child, how they become responsible and how they prioritize or handle everything that has something to do with the child\u2019s development, their future and how their relationship and connection goes is what truly matter. \u2665\ufe0f Do what you gotta do mommah! Wanting to do something with your body that doesn\u2019t harm your child is no crime. It does not make you less of a mom.",
