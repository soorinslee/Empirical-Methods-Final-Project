Goofy, loadout system, unlock weapons by taking them out of the mish with you, multiple ways to do every mission, cool consistent story that led from 1 &amp; 2, no DLC, and requiem final credits mission was truly epic. My favorite mission was A New Life because it really displayed every aspect of this game and begged to be replayed over and over each time completely different.",

There's only one level that I dislike in the game and that's Death on the Mississippi, and even then it's not a downright awful level like some of the ones in Absolution are. There's so many classic moments in Blood Money and so many levels that I'd put up there as some of my favourite in the series! In fact, Dance with the Devil is my all time favourite Hitman level period. So glad I got the Platinum Trophy for it last year. Only felt right for one of my favourite games of all time.",
