The hand guard has been trimmed away to allow the rail to be welded to the barrel or sometimes you\u2019ll find they\u2019ve got a Clamp Mount that wraps the barrel.  although the one in B4B appears to be welded. My M1A had this type of rail when I bought it. You can buy  them now from Springfield  with the rail screwed to the barrel via hex screws",
