Keep the comfortable one especially if you\u2019re gonna play a lot of hours and have it hanging from your shoulder, jumping around and what not.\n\nIf you need the better sounding and capable of multiple \u201ctones\u201d ranging from clean to hard, and you don\u2019t gig too much, keep the Les comfortable.\n\nBut the best thing to do is sell both and get one that checks all the boxes.\n\nAlso never buy a guitar with anything less than an Alder body.\n\nStill affordable but way better and brighter sounding than Basswood which most affordable guitars are made of.",
