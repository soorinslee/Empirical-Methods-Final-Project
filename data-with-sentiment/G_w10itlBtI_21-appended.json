Downdraft vents _can_ work if you have to have that clean/minimalist look, but they also can be _loud_ since they have to move a lot more air to be as effective as one directly over the cooktop. \n\nAnd please don't try to go without. I don't know if you are doing a gas range, but if you are, you absolutely can't go without. Cooking with natural gas can be nice, but it is terrible for indoor air quality, so you _have_ to be able to vent the unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, etc. that are produced.",
