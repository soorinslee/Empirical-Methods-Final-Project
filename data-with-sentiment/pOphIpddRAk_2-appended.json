Since late 70's U K is always short of Drs Nurses and hotel workers ( All East Europeans) or from Sri Lanka. \nThe native are not interested in hard work and thrift in Europe or north America they would rather stay on social security .\nAs long as they get enough money to eat and have beer and  lay about they're very happy. \nThey are not interested in made race to accumulate Dollars or Pounds to worry about getting married their children to great  \nfamily and counting their cars and a great game of finding beautiful tall fair daughter in law. So new generations of Indians are the same they are getting married to fellow Americans or British nd having great freedom and democracy.\nI live in london and visited 32 countries. I hope I haven't offended by fellow Brothers & Sisters back home.\n\nDr J S Pawar (Mithepur) london.",
