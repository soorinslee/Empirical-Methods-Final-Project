Although, the truth is you are holding on to a single hope that the person who mean the world to you would still wait until you are finally able to fix yourself being a mess but you don\u2019t wanna be a selfish one either to keep the love and stay without giving assurance to anything so you ended up choosing the hardest decision and that is to walk away carrying the faith deep in your heart that what\u2019s meant to be will always be.\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d",
