That led me to clone houses until I settled on Mont Blanc and John Varvatos as a base of my collection with Prada/D&G/Versace as the \"upper\"end of designer that I'm comfortable going for dates and dumb reaches when I use discounters. I'd love to finally own ADG but if not still love watching your content!",
