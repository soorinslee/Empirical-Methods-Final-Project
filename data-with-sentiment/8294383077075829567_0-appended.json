You're just asking to imagine if they were like them, how would you feel?\n\nYou can have issues with someone and still be in love with them, and you can have zero issues with someone and not be in love with them, and I think this question abstracts it in a way where you can figure out how you feel without having to get to the nitty gritty. Beautiful question. \n\nOfcourse, any children you might have (or might not have) aren't going to grow up exactly like either of you, and you wouldn't actually want a weird mini-me running around, lol. But if they did, you can imagine how you'd feel. Happy? Disappointed? That's feeling is saying something about your partner too then.",
