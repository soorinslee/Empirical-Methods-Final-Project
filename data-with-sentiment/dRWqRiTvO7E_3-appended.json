            "body": "I am sorry, but you are done..... by YOU I mean the USA as a functioning democracy.  Too many stupid people, too much concentration of wealth among WAY to few, and way way too many guns.  You have believed your own bullshit for too long.... we are number 1... what a joke!.  The only thing you are number 1 at that is a positive, is you have the biggest economy.  oh yes, and Number one for the number of gun deaths, guns per capita, number 1 with the greatest income disparity.... Number 30 when it comes to high school proficiency in reading, math and science.  Years of racial inequality, years of under investment in public education, and years of believing your country is the shining light on the hill.  Having lived in the USA for 4 years, I know there are many many good and smart people.  It is time to get off the couch and save your country, and you have to do it at the ballot box and elect Democrats in a real working majority or you are done. 2022 is the most important election in your history, and time is short.  It gives me no pleasure to make this observation from afar..... thank God it is from afar.",

The Attorney General Garland needs to indict trump for the insurrection and the Terrorist attack on the United States Capital. Congress need to start investigating all those republicans senators that were personally involved in meeting with groups and preparing the day before the attack in the Capital. It\u2019s unbelievable that so many months have gone by and still trump and hid corrupt republicans senators are still trying to protect themselves and trump.  Also Congress need to indict Mark Meadows who has all the knowledge of who did what in planing the insurrection and attack in the Capital.  Frustration has hit us all.",

Because they are a part of the elite club and do not want to give up their perks and donor money, which means they're just as corrupt as the rest of them in the club. To have justice you need a Just system. Right now it\u00b4s Just a corrupt system that is designed to suppress the underprivileged and make them pay, whether through privately owned jails that profit from modern-day slavery, On top of the fact that it free labor they also make them pay for any amenities, so there constantly sucking their families dry as well. Sick broken system. Through working and poor class paying the bulk of the taxes and working for low wages, that keep them from ever being able to get ahead of their bills, and high-cost medicine and people being allowed to murder without any consequences. This is not a Justice system it\u00b4s a Rotten Corruption system... Unfortunately, you can\u00b4t fix it.,   but I admire your efforts.....",
