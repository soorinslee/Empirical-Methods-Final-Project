Places where 40C\u00b0 is normal in the hottest month (Feb), it has pushed the needle to 45C\u00b0 every now and then but the average would be 35C\u00b0 a temperature that became normal to me. As I got older it really got to me, you live and work in air conditioned places and seldomly venture outside, you don't even bother to swim because the water is too hot, it becomes ridiculous, you just dont get fresh air. We recently moved to a coastal town a couple of hours away from Cape Town and it is bliss. The winters are mild and we will have a 30C\u00b0 plus summer's day now and then, it is mostly mild and cool in summer and I love it. I could never be able to live in this kind of heat in Kuwait even though I'm used to heat. Imagine 50C\u00b0!\ud83d\ude30",

With the change in climate, one would think people would be eagerly planting fast growing trees, flowers that are attractive for bees, butterflies and moths, create an ecosystem for the creatures around here, but no.  They prefer their monoculture that needs to be mowed every 3 weeks, takes a lot of water and gives nothing. Seems to me the govt should be putting out public services announcements re this situation.  But nothing but apathy and inaction , everywhere. My house looks like a cottage in a forest.. it is absolutely beautiful with the trees, lablab beans, milkweeds for the butterflies, and 4 or 5 other plants with lots of greenery and flowers , offering food and shelter to the creatures.  I wish someone would do something about this. It makes me so frustrated, because that monoculture covers all areas cement does not cover. Are we all that stupid , really?",
