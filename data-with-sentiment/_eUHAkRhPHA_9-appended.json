I make a list to get or do if it doesn\u2019t happen while they are here. Then the next time when someone stays it is much better. \nThat\u2019s when I learned about the tissues, fans, and the tub drain that wasn\u2019t draining well.",

I've been in far too many guest rooms where there is NO bedside table, hence no lamp, no surface for a book or glass of wine, and no where for kleenex or anything else.  And speaking of glass of wine, how about a bottle of wine, corkscrew and wine glasses?  Fresh flowers, some fashion magazines, small nail kit and bath oils and bath salts.  We often don't pamper ourselves at home, but when we are away it seems so much more possible.if some of these supplies are available to us/our guests.",

Thought I'd stop and take a breather as was starting to sweat!  These are great tips and pretty much all of them I do.  The one I haven't done is the hooks on the walls for some of their clothes.  Brilliant idea and will endeavour to get this done before the Christmas \"stay-overs\" start.  Many thanks",
