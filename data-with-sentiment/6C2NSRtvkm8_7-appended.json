The AA-12 was specifically engineered as an automatic combat shotgun to the point where it almost completely nullifies the recoil of even the heaviest shotgun rounds (which was demonstrated by, among others, FPSRussia, don't know if that video can still be found), so if there is any automatic shotgun that would actually be useful in a situation like this, it would be that thing.",
