BUT there are main issues: bedside table ??? - the dresser was more functional; bedside lamp ??? - well, if you sleep upside down, lol; chair = uncomfortable for working and appropriate for how many guests ???; bedcover - the color is too \"bulky\", white is a better choice because it widens the room and makes the bed less expansive AND you should have ironed the pillowcases - it looks better and it's easier to iron on the stickers...but at least you didn't sort books by colour - well, there were'nt any.",

I would say that I like the desk that you used for the work station but I disagree with the chair, given their height and the way the back of the chair slanted it's gonna cause back and neck strain. It might've also been worth it to get a bolted in monitor mount for the desk so that it can be raised or swiveled as needed. Great job seperating each space I think you really knocked this one outta the park.",
