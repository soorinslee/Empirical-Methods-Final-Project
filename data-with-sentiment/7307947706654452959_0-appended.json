In these cases I have an extremely rigid no work rule that I expect to work both ways. \n\nFor example, one employee runs a charter fishing business on the side and when I contacted him outside of work I insisted to pay full price plus gratuities to the crew.

Without realizing, my phone fell under my seat when i left the car to go in... Didnt realize i didnt have my phone on me... Well a server crashed, and nobody else was answering their phones. Obviously I didnt answer mine either since it was in the car.\n\nWhen I finally got back to the car and retrieved my phone, I had missed something like 50 calls, 20 voice mails, 15 emails and a ton of text messages... Owner and boss FURIOUS with me for not answering my phone.\n\nSo I went into the office, fixed the problem, and then got called into the owner's office with my counterpart and the owner/boss.. Everyone yelling at me about how it was my fault server was down for so long because i didnt pick up my phone nor come in for an emergency fix.\n\nI was very clear that since I bought my phone and I paid my bill, that i was able to decide when I wished to utilize said serviice. And that if they expected me to answer my phone outside of work or to fix server issues, that they had to 1) buy me a company phone and pay the plan and 2) provide me a laptop with data access. Other than that they had no right to demand anything from me.\n\nGot a new phone and laptop that i had to always have on me... but...",
