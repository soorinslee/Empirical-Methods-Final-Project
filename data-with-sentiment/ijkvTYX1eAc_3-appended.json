He gets both Pikachu and lucario to close in multiple times despite both of them getting trapped in the past going against her\nI didn't like how lucario was being used here. He's being used to fight 3 Pok\u00e9mon in a row despite supposedly being the ace in the fight for mega evolution. Against valkner it was fine because gengar was down and Pikachu had to save more energy for later on. You would think he'd use lucario a bit less for the battle until came down against dynamax.",

If this was said before then I didn't catch but if it is the first time that it's mentioned its actually a pretty big detail cause it undercuts Ash's OP team which further accentuates my theory that Ash final battle pokemon will be Pikachu and not Lucario like many believe",

The interactions in the first half were such a nice breath of fresh air and really what this series needs more of. It's trying so hard to rush all over the place and do random things and not taking any time to stop and smell the roses. Episodes like this show those little things can really make a big difference.\n\nBut seriously though. This episode is like the first time we Ash send his whole team out together in one seen. That's kinda crazy considering he caught Dracovish like 35 episodes ago.",
