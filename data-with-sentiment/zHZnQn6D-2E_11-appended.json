I'm curious if anyone ever tried hanging a pendant light on one of those ceiling command hooks? I mean, there are these very low-weight pendant lights in Ikea, the paper one or the rattan one. Instead of wiring in the light, you could stick a battery puck light in there or something. I'm considering trying these with wall sconces (they'd be attached with command hooks/strips too).",
