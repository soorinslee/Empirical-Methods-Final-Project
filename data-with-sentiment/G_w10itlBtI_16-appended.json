I have a large island and it works great for large gatherings - buffet style meals, snacks, etc.  I made sure two electrical outlets were placed under the counter edge.  Christmas baking is great with the mixer on the counter, rolling out dough, and grandkids sitting on stools decorating cookies on cookie sheets.  Lots of space and fun.",
