I\u2019m about to start a hutch (as soon as my surf prep sander arrives) that I\u2019m also doing like a Pottery Barn piece I found online in a ceruse style finish. I\u2019ve watch Crys\u2019Dawna do a couple of pieces in this finish which is what inspired me to do this solid oak piece in it. It was FREE from my neighbors who moved and didn\u2019t have room for 3 BEAUTIFUL pieces in their new house! Thx for this tutorial!",
