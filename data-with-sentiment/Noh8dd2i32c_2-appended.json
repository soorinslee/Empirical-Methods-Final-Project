The one I sleep in is barely big enough for my queen bed, two tiny nightstands, and my dresser drawers can just open. This is the bigger bedroom :-) Then add a long closet with bifold doors, and a lovely old cast iron radiator, and a large low window, and I have almost no space to work with. And did I mention there are only two electrical outlets?\n\nSeating? Hah! A rug? Double hah!\n\nDespite all that, there were some great tips I can use. Wall sconces, so I can free up space on my tiny nightstands. Lots of textures on the bed \u2014 if the bed is the whole room, it should be the most interesting thing! Smart lighting to mimic a sunset. Asymmetry. All good ideas, no matter how tiny the room.",

I mean, having a whole room for being unconsious most of the time (apart from some fun activities, sure). Kinda stupid.\nSo we built a tiny room, the size of a double bed (hight about a meter), into the wall, into the next room (a storage room). It's elevated under the cealing, so there's some space for storage undernieth. Entrance from the first room,  with four steps tight to the wall leading up to a hole in the wall.\n\nThis sulotion is our best ever. We've kept all our rooms, and can make far better use of them. And our sleeping space is cozy as hell! \ud83d\ude00",
