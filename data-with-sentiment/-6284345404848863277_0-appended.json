            "body": "I feel like step 0 is to first mentally acknowledge that you have done something wrong, and that the purpose of the apology is to express your regret, it isn't some way to passive-aggressively dodge blame. If you don't honestly think you did something wrong, but you have to apologize anyway, you still have to do this step or your apology will come out sounding fake and whatever your reason for apologizing, it won't be enough.\n\nIf you don't do this step first, most people's tendency will be to follow the next 3 steps and pepper them with passive-aggressive insinuation that really if you think about it, this is all someone else's fault and I haven't actually done anything wrong.\n\nMy culture, at least, has normalized the idea of an apology just being yet another way to prove you haven't done anything wrong. If you don't think you've done anything wrong, don't apologize. If you're apologizing, make it clear you accept responsibility for your own actions.\n\nYou can definitely do both, you can say you're sorry for one thing while also saying you don't think you're responsible for something else. In that case, make sure they are two separate statements, and absolutely make sure you aren't conveying the idea of, \"the thing someone else did means the thing I did isn't even bad\" or else you're still just avoiding responsibility and shouldn't be apologizing.\n\nOn a related note. I used to work in live television, so the margin for error was very narrow when people are on television literally now. I trained a guy, I think overall I trained him well, but one of the things I taught him was what he should do when, inevitably, he made a mistake.\n\nLiterally his first day solo he made a huge blunder that caused an on-air error. At the commercial he was getting reamed for it. When the manager yelling at him paused for breath, he did exactly what I told him to do. He said, \"Sir, I'm sorry. I know what I did, and it will not happen again.\" No explanation, no excuses (largely for reasons of time, the commercial was going to end soon and we'd be back on air.)\n\nAnd. That was the end of it. The manager shook his hand, congratulated him on taking responsibility and focusing on what mattered, and went back to the show. He ended up taking another job after a few months but basically the whole scenario made him a hero and he didn't get in much trouble for his mistake.\n\nHe didn't try to foist off any blame, he didn't make excuses, he expressed sincere regret and most importantly the responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen again. In the moment, the manager did not need to know the specifics, there was no time for something like that. My trainee was still the only person right there who could have done that job in the 90 seconds they had before the commercial ended, and he convinced them (and was right) that his mistake didn't mean he couldn't do it.",
