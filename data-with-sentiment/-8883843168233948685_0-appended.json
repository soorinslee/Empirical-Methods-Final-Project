            "body": "&gt;Over the summer school board members in the Waukesha school district made headlines after they voted to leave a federal free meals program because they worried it made it easy for families to \u201cbecome spoiled\u201d or develop an \u201caddiction\u201d to the service. Imagine if kids became addicted to the government ensuring they didn\u2019t starve, eh?\n\nThis is at the core of why the wealthy don't like government. In their minds they fund all of government and it all goes to spoilt poors who can't afford it on their own. \n\nIf those poors take too much of a liking to government and government services they are sure to keep voting for tax increases so that more services can be provided. \n\nThe wealthy would provide that the government do three basic things. Protect their wealth, promote their business interests, and protect them personally against their own actions. \n\nIt's amazing how this message is being parroted at school board meetings now and is taking food from kids mouths to protect the accumulated wealth of a few.",
