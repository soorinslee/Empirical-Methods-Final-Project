Getting sick can happen to anybody; and the reason for sickness is quite often hereditary. You might argue that individuals with student loans should have thought about the debt they incurred when they got the loans (just like anybody else who borrows they should understand loans must be repaid). Also, it doesn't seem fair to students who worked several jobs to pay for their education or for parents who saved and made enormous sacrifices to pay for their children's education so the children would not have to be burdened by student loans.",
