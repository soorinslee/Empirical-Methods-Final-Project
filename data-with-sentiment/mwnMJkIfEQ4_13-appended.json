The lies are told in public, and regardless of how and when they are disproven, the far right media has the video and audio clips to use to feed their flock.  The truth doesn't matter. You telling this story right now matters, but only if those who can see the truth will do something about it. They know they are lying - they are doing it because they get the lie recorded, just like all of 45's speeches and letters and press releases, etc - they get out there, like the WSJ 'opinion' that should never have gone to print - because now it is out there, and 45's followers will see that, and they aren't listening to anyone who will tell them the truth. The only way to stop the lies is to stop the liars.  Someone has to stop TC on Fox from doing what he's doing.",
