In addition, it is not exactly pleasant for the animals. A wheel with columns is also very bad. Since it can happen that the hamsters get stuck between the spokes with their paws and if it continues to turn, they can break something. A wheel that is completely lined with wood or cork from the inside is best. Or you can take one made of rodent-friendly plastic.",
