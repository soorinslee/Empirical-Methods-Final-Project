If more people did like she does, and as the meteorologist wants to do (create the forest in the north) it would really make an impact *_* I want to support that!\n\nEdit: Just heard the influencer talk about the fear for what the children's future looks like (I feel you sister).. Now, I don't know what research she has done on what SHE can do, but I hope she goes and does some and then gets herself and her family immersed in making a change. For starters, turn of the AC, move out of the high rise and stop consuming luxury (IMPORTED) items. Easier said than done, but doable.",
