Almost 70-80% of them didn't pay any wages to their maids/servants during the lockdown themselves. Always bargain aggresively with the vegetable/fruit vendor for every penny and then complain about companies not paying them enough!! Bunch of hippocrates. If you have excuses/reasons for your wrong doing then you have no right to blaim your employer for giving less hike than expected. Atleast they gave you hike even if it was 5% whereas you yourself didn't pay any to your maids/servants.",

People on daily wages were making less money than the unemployment benefits. So people decided to leave their job to sit at home to claim unemployment benefits. So that they make more money without having to work. This is for the short term. As the economy bounes back and bottomline improves. Companies will start offering better wages than unemployment benefits and those who left will join back.

These skyscrapers will now become somewhat obsolete, causing their values to plummet, if no one will rent these spaces do we implode the buildings as one Chinese construction company was forced to do or can we find a better use for them?\nIn the west and probably elsewhere, housing for ppl. is a major problem let alone quality housing, surely these structures could easily be refurbished/remodeled into affordable accommodations for the poorer ppl. I'm not talking about spacious apartments but affordable living quarters that allow ppl. the safety of NOT being destitute and on the streets. Even in western countries we now have a class of ppl. that are forced to live in danger on the streets due to ridiculously high rents.\nI wish I understood your name (maybe spell it for us) but I think you present what you say very effectively (apart from your name \ud83e\udd23) Your message is clear and concise congratulations!",
