In some Fords (I drive fleet vehicles for work, I wouldn't choose to drive Ford), you don't have to touch the light or wiper controls as both have automatic settings. As in, the lights are on when the engine is, off when it's not, high beams on when the sun is down and no vehicles are coming (it has radar), high beams off when the sun is down and vehicles *are* coming (or ahead of us). Likewise, the wipers are off while the windshield is dry, and they adjust their speed based on how much water is on the windshield. I don't know how that works, but it does. On the newer vehicles, I never touch the light or wiper controls. They just work.\n\nMy own personal vehicle has none of those options, so I turn the headlights on after starting the car. Seatbelt, ignition, set mirrors, set up radio (Bluetooth), start playlist or audiobook, **lights**, transmission, gas. (And yes, I know the gas pedal is giving the carburetor or fuel injection system *air*, not *fuel*.)\n\nAnd yes, I'll flash someone if their lights aren't on. It's no big deal if they don't turn them on, it's more of a courtesy kind of thing, since we do have a lights/wipers law here.",

I used to be EMS and a majority of our calls in the rain were always people that had minor/major accidents because some blockhead thought they were too good to have their lights on. This was especially an issue on the damn highways out of all places.

The situations where you need your headlights to see the road/surroundings is a subset contained entirely within the set of situations where other people need your headlights to see you.\n\nTherefore, the decision point on whether headlights are necessary is whether or not they're needed to ensure that you're visible to other vehicles, NOT whether you need them to see.  Or, as other have noted, just drive with your headlights/running lights on at all times and don't think about it further.",
