The call centre office of \"Game Guru's\", a 1900 gamer guide hotline where I played Perfect Dark, months before launch on an EEPROM cartridge - some of the top staff there spoke about the working version of the game where the Gameboy camera face function was completely operational.  \nThe reason it never made it to release is because of the Columbine Shooting and the idea of being able to put any face on a bot for deathmatch (friends, teachers, principals etc).  It absolutely worked, but current events squashed it.",

Showing every version of the Gameboy along with the Super Nintendo and Gamecube is unnecessary, especially after mentioning you can take a picture in the game itself.
