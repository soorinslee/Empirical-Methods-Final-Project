Like the period before it there was no icecaps but with even higher temperatures and CO2 levels. Did the world shrivel up under the blistering heat? No, the fossil record shows it was covered in tropical rain forest and supported the development of early mammals including our primate ancestors. So instead of images of parched desserts, imagine sitting on the treetops looking out over a luxuriant green canopy or bathing in the warm waters of the arctic circle. If there ever was a 'Garden of Eden' that led to the eventual establishment of man this was it.  If you are still not convinced you only have to go back to the warmer periods in the Roman and Medieval times. The later witnessed Southern England with a climate akin to the Loire valley today and Greenland being more habitable than present (encouraging a brief Viking settlement). Let us not also forget the remains of vast forests that lie under Northern Tundra revealing a time of warmer weather that made more of the world more habitable.",
