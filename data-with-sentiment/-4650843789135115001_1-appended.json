Humor subverts expectations.\n* 4 is a weird-looking number. Just look at it.\n* 4 isn't easily confused with any other letters or numbers.\n* 3 isn't enough anymore. Comedy used to come in threes, but inflation brought it up to 4.\n* 5 is too many and looks like the letter S.\n* 1 can look like an l, or a 7, or just a confusing line on a slip of paper.\n* 6 sounds too much like \"sex.\"\n* 7 is too predictable. Everyone picks 7. Don't pick 7.\n* 8 is slightly funny, but it looks like a B when handwritten.\n* 2 sucks. I'm not going to choose 2 because I hate it.\n* 9 is too odd and, frankly, 9 is a creepy number. I would watch out for anyone who chooses 9.\n* And anything more than 2 digits kills the joke.\n\nThat's why you should use 4, in my experience.",
