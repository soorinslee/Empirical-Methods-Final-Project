I don\u2019t know why we need to see the application of more of the same. It\u2019s not only you, but many influencers keep doing the same look. If that\u2019s all that\u2019s going to be showcased, why bother watching or buying anything else? Cheeks, lips, eyebrow preparations, all new things get a try. But when it comes to eyeshadow, let\u2019s run to the same old same old. \nYes, you may try the other palette at some point in time, but when you didn\u2019t try it today, seems like you view the colors as, \u201cmeh, maybe when I get around to it\u201d.
