Other truth is it goes in an 800 year cycle of Temperature Rising and Cooling because which is due to Sea absorbing Co2 when and after 800 years releases Co2 were now nearing the 800 years cycle and thus why planet is warmer but were still not experiencing the heat levels seen in Medieval Times",

The troposphere, that's the part of the atmosphere we live in, is defined by molecules with a temperature of -60\u2070 C and above.  Emissions of IR from CO2 @ 15 microns cannot heat any molecules in the troposphere. That would violate the laws of physics.\nIt is the sun that drives the climate on earth and not humans or our carbon emissions.",

This is all mainstream media too no doubt. because what they need are another global scale, vague yet catastrophic dangers. to keep us unable to act. a vague threat means there are no clear ways to make meaningful progress to solve, leading to anxiety and depression. also meaning overwhelming resources go towards efforts claiming to tackle it, instead of putting them towards clearer, solvable problems, which in turn would help to solve environmental crises'. \nAfter 15 minutes of doom and gloom, we are told our best option is mitigation and adaptation. no solutions. No one at the UN seems to think its conceivable that we are able to solve this problem? how is any of this type of messaging helpful? If the problems are so dire, and the world is the richest its ever been, how about we go about funding research into actionable plans, to solve these problems.",
