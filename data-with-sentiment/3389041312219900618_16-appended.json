By our standards, you HAVE and ALWAYS WILL HAVE missed important material if you aren\u2019t in attendance. Most of us in the liberal arts have 15 weeks in which to deliver 20-25 chapters (as a general benchmark) of content. We spend weeks perfecting that syllabus every damn semester, only for it to be ignored despite the fact that it lays out the entire course, all the readings, and all the homework*. It\u2019s beyond insulting, it\u2019s like you could care less and thus it not only irritates the professor, it makes you look like a lazy fool and I guarantee it impacts your grade in some way, given how subjective they are. There have definitely been times when I\u2019ve declined to round up an 87.5 to an A- for a student who had pestered me with b.s. like that (more than once). \n\n* Even if the syllabus is sparse or the class behind/ahead, there are *how many other students* in the class you could ask? \n\nIf you *are* going to ask the prof because the syllabus is crap and fellow students have been unhelpful - at least try to ask during office hours, not just before/after the lecture. And if you communicate by email, make sure that email has a decent subject line, a professional greeting, polite language, and is free of spelling/grammar errors - it\u2019s one thing to be a bit annoying, it\u2019s another thing to be purposely obtuse.\n\n* PS. if you aren\u2019t getting a detailed syllabus from your professor with all the info you need (assuming the missing info isn\u2019t online somewhere), complain to the department chair and then feel free to annoy the fuck out of them with your \u201cdid I miss anything?s\u201d.",
