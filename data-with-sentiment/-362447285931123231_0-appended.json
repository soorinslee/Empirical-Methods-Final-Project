            "body": "Here's the text of the article:  \nBy Luke Broadwater  \nOct. 30, 2021, 5:02 a.m. ET  \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Donald J. Trump is seeking to block from release a wide range of documents related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the National Archives said Saturday in an early-morning federal court filing detailing what Mr. Trump is fighting to keep secret.  \nIn the filing, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, John Laster, the director of the National Archives\u2019 presidential materials division, laid out for the first time exactly which documents Mr. Trump was asserting executive privilege over. The former president is hoping to prevent the documents from being reviewed by the House committee empowered to investigate the mob violence at the Capitol.  \nAccording to the filing, Mr. Trump has asserted executive privilege specifically over 770 pages of documents, including 46 pages of records from the files of Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff; Stephen Miller, his former senior adviser; and Patrick Philbin, his former deputy counsel. Mr. Trump is also objecting to the release of the White House Daily Diary \u2014 a record of the president\u2019s movements, phone calls, trips, briefings, meetings and activities \u2014 as well as logs showing phone calls to the president and to Vice President Mike Pence concerning Jan. 6, Mr. Laster wrote.  \nMr. Trump has also asserted executive privilege over 656 pages that include proposed talking points for Kayleigh McEnany, his former press secretary; a handwritten note concerning Jan. 6; a draft text of a presidential speech for the \u201cSave America\u201d rally that preceded the mob attack; and a draft executive order on the topic of election integrity, the filing states.  \nFinally, Mr. Trump asserted executive privilege over 68 additional pages, including a draft proclamation honoring the Capitol Police and two officers who died after the riot, Brian D. Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, as well as related emails; a memo about a potential lawsuit against several states that Joseph R. Biden Jr. won in the November election; an email chain from a state official regarding election-related issues; and talking points on alleged election irregularities in one Michigan county.  \nThe filing comes in response to a lawsuit Mr. Trump filed this month against the National Archives seeking to block the disclosure of White House files related to his actions and communications surrounding the Jan. 6 riot.  \nIn that lawsuit, in a 26-page complaint, a lawyer for Mr. Trump argued that the materials must remain secret as a matter of executive privilege. The lawyer said the Constitution gave the former president the right to demand their confidentiality even though he was no longer in office \u2014 and even though President Biden has refused to assert executive privilege over them.  \nThe lawsuit touched off what is likely to be a major legal battle between Mr. Trump and the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, in which a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol seeking to disrupt Congress\u2019s counting of electoral votes to formalize Mr. Biden\u2019s victory. Its outcome will carry consequences for how much the panel can uncover about Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the riot, pose thorny questions for the Biden administration and potentially forge new precedents about presidential prerogatives and the separation of powers.  \nThe leaders of the committee, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit as \u201cnothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct our probe.\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election,\u201d Mr. Thompson, the committee\u2019s chairman, and Ms. Cheney, the vice chairwoman, wrote in a statement after the suit\u2019s filing.  \nA key issue yet untested. Donald Trump\u2019s power as former president to keep information from his White House secret has become a central issue in the House\u2019s investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Amid a new lawsuit by Mr. Trump and a move to hold Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress, here\u2019s a breakdown of executive privilege:  \nWhat is executive privilege? It is a power claimed by presidents under the Constitution to prevent the other two branches of government from gaining access to certain internal executive branch information, especially confidential communications involving the president or among his top aides.  \nWhat is Trump\u2019s claim? Former President Trump has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the disclosure of White House files related to his actions and communications surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. He argues that these matters must remain a secret as a matter of executive privilege.  \nIs Trump\u2019s privilege claim valid? We probably won\u2019t know for a long time, if ever. The constitutional line between a president\u2019s secrecy powers and Congress\u2019s investigative authority is hazy. Historically, such disputes have usually been resolved through compromise, not judicial rulings.  \nIs executive privilege an absolute power? No. Even a legitimate claim of executive privilege may not always prevail in court. During the Watergate scandal in 1974, the Supreme Court upheld an order requiring President Richard M. Nixon to turn over his Oval Office tapes.  \nMay ex-presidents invoke executive privilege? Yes, but courts may view their claims with less deference than those of current presidents. In 1977, the Supreme Court said Nixon could make a claim of executive privilege even though he was out of office, though the court ultimately ruled against him in the case.  \nIs Steve Bannon covered by executive privilege? This is unclear. If any contempt finding against Mr. Bannon evolves into legal action, it would raise the novel legal question of whether or how far a claim of executive privilege may extend to communications between a president and an informal adviser outside of the government.  \nWhat is contempt of Congress? It is a sanction imposed on people who defy congressional subpoenas. Congress can refer contempt citations to the Justice Department and ask for criminal charges. Mr. Bannon could be held in contempt if he refuses to comply with a subpoena that seeks documents and testimony.  \nThe committee has demanded detailed records about Mr. Trump\u2019s every movement and meeting on the day of the assault. The panel\u2019s demands, sent to the National Archives and Records Administration, include material about any plans formed within the White House or other federal agencies to derail the Electoral College vote count by Congress.  \n\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s claims of executive privilege fail because the privilege is not absolute, and here it is outweighed by Congress\u2019s compelling need for information about the extraordinary attack that occurred on the Capitol,\u201d lawyers for the government wrote Saturday in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cThe committee\u2019s investigation into the Jan. 6 attack plainly embodies a legitimate legislative purpose.\u201d  \nIn a pair of letters this month to the National Archives, which is the custodian of White House papers from Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure, Mr. Biden\u2019s top White House lawyer, Dana Remus, made clear that the current president did not think a claim of executive privilege was legitimate under these circumstances.  \nMr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit names as defendants Mr. Thompson and David S. Ferriero, the head of the National Archives.",
