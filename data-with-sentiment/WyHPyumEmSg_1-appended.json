I\u2019ve gotten into the game over the past year or two through videos from you and others and now play Arena every day, but my paper experience consists of\u2026let\u2019s just say informal \u2018games\u2019 as a kid 20+ years ago. I\u2019d love to build some decks and find a playgroup, but the idea is kind of intimidating, since arena takes care of everything for me, and I feel like I\u2019d show up wildly unprepared and inadvertently annoy my opponents. Any tips on things for someone who\u2019s only ever played Arena to expect and prepare for in that transition would be appreciated, and I\u2019m guessing there are others in the same boat. Thanks!",
