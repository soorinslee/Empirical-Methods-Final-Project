I did like the other two shortlisted pieces and how both focused on completely different aspects of the landscape. Made it hard to choose between them but I liked that Tom won. I felt his piece represented the overall landscape better.",

However, when she chose to change mediums, her canvas didn\u2019t grab me by the shoulder\u2019s and say\u2026that\u2019s it! Thanks so much for the post as we wait weekly for it\u2019s appearance!",
