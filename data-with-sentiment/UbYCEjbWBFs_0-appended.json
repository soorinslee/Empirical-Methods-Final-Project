But it's quite a ambitious dream to think that some trees in the desert would change it noticably. Think about all the heat coming from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The amount of thermal mass is incredible by comparison.\n\nI think that this city is a heat island, in the desert, like many of the urban landscapes of that region. And it absolutely is a \"snowball\" effect in terms of making it even hotter attempting to cool it down with a/c.\n\nPotential short term solutions could be to decrease activities in the summer. Basically, get people in doors, and reduce the need to commute. It's definitely better in the winter, and that should be their \"summer\", in terms of activity. It's not something you can just do on a whim though, they need economic support during down times.\n\nIn extreme climates like this, you really have to think outside the box. Maybe there's a way to store the cold during the winter, and use it to regulate the summer. Sounds absurd though.",
