These sellers or agents from Idukki and Kochi are all over the facebook groups if youre looking for cardamom. Also, it's true that cardamom's colour has a lot do with how easily it can be sold to retailers, so it fetches good value. For this, you can sometimes have the sellers / farmers add artificial colour for your batch, which is a common practice not unheard of.",
