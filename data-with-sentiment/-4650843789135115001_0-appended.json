After the last time, I went back to my seat in between 2 other guys and got a few hours of sleep. I woke up when we were about to arrive to Mexico City and was just waiting for the plane to land so I could take my stuff and leave, and out of nowhere this super cute blonde-blue eyed German hostess that I was taking to earlier walks to my row, hands me a piece of paper and said: \u201cthat\u2019s my phone number, me and the rest of the crew are going to hang out tonight in M\u00e9xico D.F. and it\u2019d be cool if you\u2019d join us.\u201d The 2 guys in my row looked at me with their eyes wide opened as I was holding the piece of paper and replying to the air hostess that I\u2019d love to join, still not sure if I was being pranked or what.

Consequently, the \"relationship\" lasts insofar that this pressuring\u2014and the facade that comes from *acting*, i.e. pretending to be someone you're not\u2014can be sustained. What a terrible, fatiguing, and mentally draining way to live (if one wants to be more attractive, identify what's holding you back and improve those deficits). The toxicity of such pickup advice stems from objectifying women, i.e. not viewing women as human beings but rather as sub-human objects that are to be manipulated; not surprisingly, the advice tends to only work on insecure women.\n\nIn fact, this objectification and subsequent dehumanizing of people, regardless of sex/gender isn't specific to dating/pickup. It's pretty common in many other areas in life if you're observant. The implied philosophical premise is that people don't have free will and instead are deterministic so all one needs to do to get someone to do X is to do Y.\n\nThe premise of determinism is false because people fundamentally have a *choice* whether to *focus*\u2014and remain in focus, i.e. concentrate\u2014on any given thing to identify whether X is good. Human behavior *appears* deterministic insofar that people choose not to remain in focus and instead rely on their sub-human, animalistic impulses and associations (their more human traits are mimicked, often by pressure to conform, from those who more consistently exercise their free will and rationality; their parroting of others is often revealed when they don't understand what contexts in which a behavior applies), which unfortunately is prevalent in today's times. Dismissing people who don't fit these molds because they're statistical outliers is cherry-picking qua rationalizing and consequently overgeneralization; it also encourages conformity by using statistical averages, i.e. what is most popular, as standards of mental health.",

            "body": "That's a good way to never hear from a girl again. You're basically putting the onus on her to make the first move, initiate contact, open the conversation up, etc. The vast majority of girls won't do this (and honestly aren't completely comfortable doing this unless they're a super dominant forward girl) unless you've established super high interest in the initial interaction. And if that's the case and she has crazy high interest, then why don't you simply recognize that, get her number, and then make the moves? In the long run, over the course of many interactions, most all of the time, you're going to lose points for having girls take your number down. It's simply not attractive. It looks weak in the early stages of the interaction, which are crucial. You should KNOW that you're a high value dude and that she's interested and operate from that mindset. You should ASSUME she would want you to text her and set up plans since you guys are standing there talking and vibing. And rather than a fun text Convo in her phone that you started that she can respond to and remember, if you throw your number at her, you're just another of the countless contacts in her phone, and worse than that you're a contact that she's never even texted/called.\n\nA number is not just a number. Numbers have an element of quality. Some girl who you talked to for 5 mins, didn't vibe with much at all and was wishy washy about the number exchange after you were awkward about the number, yeah that's not going anywhere. A girl that you spent 25 mins, sat down with, vibed, and got to a point where you're comfortable with each other, and started discussing a date/activity with, and it felt like the number was just the natural profession of the interaction and a way to keep in contact and make plans with,  has a MASSIVELY higher chance of working out. Ideally you have enough social/emotional intelligence to gauge whether this is ACTUALLY someone that wants to see you again so you don't put low interest girls in the position of exchanging numbers out of obligation. Truthfully the number means very little, it's the events leading up to that number.\n\nGetting HER number also gives you an opportunity to call back to some joke you guys shared when meeting, and come right out of the gate with a text that isn't the typical \"hey good meeting you\" shit that quickly devolves into boring \"you too\" or \"how's your day?\". You can VERY quickly differentiate yourself from the last ten boring dudes she talked to. You can even shoot her a flirty/funny text while she's still in front of you, and often they'll find it funny text you right back and now suddenly the lines of communication over phone are already wide open in a flirty, playful way and you've eliminated that weird first text stage and moved to \"fun guy that I'm talking to\" stage where it only feels natural to meet up again (or at least text throughout the day or call each other up until your schedules allow). \n\nYou can reinitiate contact quickly and in a fun way by doing this and keep the vibe up instead of her putting it off for three days because she forgets or isn't sure what to say, the attraction fades, and (if she even remembers she \"has\" to text you at all) she starts rationalizing \"eh maybe he wasn't that cool after all\". Girls these days have so many options and you NEED to keep it hot make a meetup happen within a few days or it will fizzle out. Throwing your number out in the wind like that HOPING she'll contact you just gives the potential to slow things down and make them feel less smooth and happenstance to her (and looks bad and increases the chances she will NEVER talk to you again). \n\nYou're making a big deal of figuring out whether she's interested or not. It's not that cryptic.  Want to know how you know she's interested? She responds to your first text. If she doesn't respond to a follow up then it's done and you move on and then it's TRULY on her to initiate communication if she's interested.",

All the women I've known want a man of action, a doer, and giving your number is very passive.",

But she didn't show it. We talked for the first time and I gave her my number so as not to come on too strong. She didn't realize that I hadn't gotten hers. She figured I'd call, and I never did, so I must not be interested. Almost missed the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWe bumped into each other later, ended up getting together, and had a laugh about it afterward. But she always thought it was weird. She told me that even if she hadn't just blanked out about me not getting her number, she probably wouldn't have called. She would have assumed I wasn't that interested if I didn't bother to ask for her number.   \n\n\nI realize that's a one-off situation, but you're also putting the pressure on the other person. I think it's a mistake to assume that it will definitely come across as confidence. It could just as easily be viewed as arrogance. You're basically saying, \"You want to pursue this? YOU make a move.\"  \n\n\nLike most hard rules for dating or meeting people, take this with a grain of salt. Everyone is different and responds to these situations differently. There may be situations where giving your number out is a better idea than asking for theirs, but it's going to depend on the situation, the other person, and your dynamic with them.",

Humor subverts expectations.\n* 4 is a weird-looking number. Just look at it.\n* 4 isn't easily confused with any other letters or numbers.\n* 3 isn't enough anymore. Comedy used to come in threes, but inflation brought it up to 4.\n* 5 is too many and looks like the letter S.\n* 1 can look like an l, or a 7, or just a confusing line on a slip of paper.\n* 6 sounds too much like \"sex.\"\n* 7 is too predictable. Everyone picks 7. Don't pick 7.\n* 8 is slightly funny, but it looks like a B when handwritten.\n* 2 sucks. I'm not going to choose 2 because I hate it.\n* 9 is too odd and, frankly, 9 is a creepy number. I would watch out for anyone who chooses 9.\n* And anything more than 2 digits kills the joke.\n\nThat's why you should use 4, in my experience.",
