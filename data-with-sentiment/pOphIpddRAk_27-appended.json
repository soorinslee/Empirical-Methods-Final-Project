Though some didn't want to be home at first, I think many people eventually found out they enjoyed it! And could do the exact same jobs at home with far less stress and effort!\n\nThat makes them angry for being a slave to the hamster wheel and realise they can save time and money from not travelling to a location they don't even like and doing strict hours when they'd rather be flexible. \n\nWork and life balance is probably more obvious now. People staying home with their children for the first time in their lives realise what they missed out on and how valuable they really are to their family and the upside of time together. \n\nA job is disposable, but people are not. Once the job is gone no one at work misses you. But when you're gone it is your family who miss you. Well they may stop missing you and give up eventually if you never come back to spend that time with them and put work first all the time.",
