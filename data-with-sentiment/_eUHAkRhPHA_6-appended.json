I make a list to get or do if it doesn\u2019t happen while they are here. Then the next time when someone stays it is much better. \nThat\u2019s when I learned about the tissues, fans, and the tub drain that wasn\u2019t draining well.",

Most decorative throws seem smaller. \n\nBTW, I have a friend who comes into town for work once a month. She used to stay at an AirB&B, even though I always offered my guest bedroom. She finally took me up on my offer and now she always stays with me when she\u2019s in town because she loves how comfortable and at home she feels when she\u2019s my guest. Now that I\u2019ve seen your video, I found a couple of things I can do better that will blow her mind! Can\u2019t wait to implement them on her next visit! (She may not want to leave \ud83d\ude02). \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",

I realized that when my daughter started running wires all over the place on the guest room! \nFabulous video has always. Need to get on to your your new design club. \ud83d\ude0d",
