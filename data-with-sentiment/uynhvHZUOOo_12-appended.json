Also when countries get richer they cut emissions per capita. But I guess we should just use climate change as an excuse to transfer money to your green corporate doners. Your concern is not human well-being if you think the government should reduce our access and use of them, poverty kills. And also subsidising \u201cgreen\u201d energy just takes money form more productive parts of the economy, so we are poorer, and that kills.",
