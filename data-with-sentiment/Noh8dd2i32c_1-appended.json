The design on the dark grey accent wall behind the headboard that the lamp lights throw on the wall above the bed is magnificent, and goes amazingly with my subdued checked design scheme for the room.  A surprise treat!  The shelf doesn't provide the best functionality, but with remote outlets for the lamps, at least the lighting element is a convenience, and provides a layering of lighting options along with the dimmable overhead light for the room.  The final piece of the puzzle will be having 4\" wide \u00d7 3 ft long custom night stands built in on both sides of the bed for stowing cell phones, cups of water and/or reading glasses. (Yes, unfortunately, 4\" is not a typo!)  I just have to find the right contractor.",
