I don\u2019t live in Canada \ud83d\ude29 but I need some help with my studio. It\u2019s 370 sq feet not including bathroom since it is a step up inside the studio. Wondering if it would be okay if I share some fotos of how it is now. It is a garage converted no walls or divisions in it just a big square. I will only share fotos if you answer me back. I have a decorator inside me I know but not as stylish as you are. Will appreciate any input. Thank you for always being so fun, smart and aware of the world you live in. See you soon.\ud83d\udc33",
