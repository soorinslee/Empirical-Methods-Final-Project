Yes, it's hot because Kuwaitis are enjoying a modern, civilised, concrete jungle in the middle of the scorching desert heat. I mean, kudos to the older woman and the meteorologist for recognising this, acknowledging the problem, and proposing feasible solutions followed by real action and \"boots on the ground.\" Other than that, what I got from the \"influencer\" was whining about how hot it is, how much she and her family suffer, and how to live your life around this heat crisis by structuring daily necessities, etc. Pathetic and sad, I recommend an additional crisis be recorded for Kuwait to tackle... a detached generation of spoiled brats who want cooler temperatures without having to give up any of their modern-day luxuries or change any of their carbon inducing habits.",

Humans create less than a thousandth, much less, by the IPCC's own figures, of so called greenhouse gasses, but we are supposed to believe it contributes a measurable warming effect? The Earth is colder now, a lot colder that at most other times since life arrived, there has been no measurable increase in the gradual rise in sea level ever since the end if the last Ice Age, in fact the IPCC has run out of sea level experts to have on there advisory list, they have all refused to go along with the sea level predictions which are just stupid. 1934 was warmer by a long way than any time since. The last 6 months have been the coldest since records started in Antarctica. And most importantly we already know that CO2 levels are driven by temperature, Not the other way round, as Al Gore pretended in his film, by showing a graph back to front. That film got him an Oscar and a Nobel prize, so we know those two bodies are in on the scam, because they know that he lied outright, many times in An Inconvenient Truth. The only people who believe in it are simply people who know nothing about it. Well that's my rant for the evening.",
