Yet a year ago, the US had 0% vaccinated and now  it is at 58% vaccinated.. but double the cases? Why isn't anybody mentioning the words \"treatment failure?\" Even if the vaxxn magically lowers severity of disease, will that offset double the number of cases? Is there really any benefit to this expensive, burdensome and divisive therapy?  Can anyone imagine giving polio or mumps vaccines and seeing their numbers double a year later? Who would support that? I have heard the word \"variant\" mentioned. But those are subsets of the whole coronavirus infections.  Every treatment must be judged on how effective it is in combatting the whole, not subsets of the disease. Are we wasting time, money and resources on these vaxxns? Am I allowed to even ask that question?",
