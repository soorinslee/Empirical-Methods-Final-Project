Show their houses  in London flooded to death, or Paris shopping while cooked. Show them California silicon Valley a desert and LA flooded. Show them their rich houses and wealthy life in NY destroyed, in the cold storms. Show them the Mediterranean Europe destroyed by the new typhoons in the Mediterranean Sea. Only then you'll be effective.\nThis is not a problem of greedy old generations, but also new millennial kids generating their richness by e-commerce, by buying over the super polluter Internet.\nBut at the end you are the Economist another riches owned magazine who just need to make profit not scoops nor showing the reality.
