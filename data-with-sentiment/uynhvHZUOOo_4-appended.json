I propose that we ask all the world governments to allow one or more of their top scientists and/or inventors to work together with other countries' top experts to transform CO2 gas in the atmosphere to environmentally safe substances or gasses. Why do I say this? Because they are opening up new coal mines at this writing. Let's be real; no one is going to stop burning fossil fuels until its too late. The only viable solution is to solve the problem at the source. The atmosphere is heating up because there is too much CO2. Let's put the top brains and talent of the entire world into coming up with machines that pull out the CO2 to acceptable levels. We are dreaming to think by certain governments diminishing their emissions by miniscule amounts that this is going to work.",
