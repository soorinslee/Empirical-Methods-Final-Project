I don't know how the camera works, but it's likely a shoddy sensor or a bad low cost tech that's susceptible to interference. The lines are regular and fixed, which would make me guess that it's coming from the gcn itself. Could be any kind of signal, or just a field coming from the traces on the board, a wire, literally anything could be causing it.",

Luckily though, there was a character there already, which looked much like I was already. With a big nose and long hair in a ponytail. I always chose him and even more amazingly, all my friends I played the game with also had scans of people who looked very much like them, so we always chose them and the illusion of fighting against each other was real. We were lucky.",
