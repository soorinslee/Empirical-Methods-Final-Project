Is it something only certain banks do or can you just leave it in an index etf and it will compound?\n\nI understand there\u2019s a lot more info available but honestly depending on how humble your background you won\u2019t likely even know the right questions to ask. Any advice is appreciated thx for your post man",

When I was a kid I thought it just happened;  you worked till a certain a age and then you just retired.. where I grew up the complete surrounding area (that's the major city and the suburban area of up to 10 city's surrounding it), the average home is a million dollars and it's only going up.  that's also  with out a representation of a wage that supports housing markets. So now the idea if being able to retire means if I wanted to live where I grew up, (most comfortable)  as my initial plan it only means I'll just be able to own a home.  I do understand that  retirement is a financial status and not a state of being . \n\nIt's just soo depressing that the methodology of saving for retirement for my generation of individual born in the 80s  has been thrown on its  head; what we were told about saving is still a manageable thing, just that final outcome isn't really going to be close to the initial vision\n\nThat idea of being able to have your house paid off before you retire, have one or two kids off to collage or university  before you retire, and then have money set aside to live comfortably and be able to travel a little.. own a pleasure vehicle or something for retirement... these things can not happen , full stop, or not in any  realistic manner .. even if you  were extremely reserved with your spending through your life time , just having a family of one or two kids and allowing them a moderately fulfilled life as they grow up  almost makes this not attainable. \n\n\nI'm not trying to discredit your post; I think it's still is sound advise you should always be saving because you never know if you know if you know  a virus will come along an disrupt the world on a global scale  and you could very well loose your job , or you may just need an expensive surgery that's not covered.  It's just  I think the perspective that  you just retire  even if you have put money into savings and investments is not a straightforward as people think ..",
