Like if the first one was for a 101 course, the new one was your Masters thesis...\n\nI honestly had been working on it since he initially assigned it.  And I think I had managed to work out all of the logic and such I needed.  But unfortunately my schedule was rather chaotic and I had ended up writing the entire program on three or four different systems without access to the stuff I had coded before, on systems that didn't have the software to even write code on.\n\nI compiled all of my various bits into a single file and I was starting to work on making sure it all meshed, I used the same naming system throughout etc...  Unfortunately come Wednesday I notice I had a lot more work to still do and I wouldn't get done by the time it was due on Friday.\n\nSo I stopped by his office and asked if I could please have a little more time...  I'd be able to finish it off over the weekend for sure and be able to submit it on Monday.\n\nNope.  He was tired of us kids waiting until the very last second to start working on his assignment and finding out too late they're more complicated than we had anticipated.\n\nI told him I had been working on it since the start and had it pretty well done I just needed a little more time to get everything working.  I offered to show him my code to prove it but he wouldn't bite...\n\nA lot of the other kids were going to protest and not hand anything in...  But I couldn't not hand anything in so I added the code I was still working on to the first assignment this one was based on, commented my stuff out so the program would work as it should.  I figured he'd at least be able to see what I was trying to go for.\n\nFast forward a week or so later...  Half the class got 0/100...  I ended up getting 70/100.",

It was worth 10% of our *total* mark.  He had the due date smack dab in the middle of mid-terms, so he told us if we couldn't complete it on time to e-mail him and we were allowed extensions.  No big deal.\n\nI e-mailed him 4 days before the due date letting him know it would likely be late.  I had finished my research just a matter of writing it up... and did that on same day it was due (had 2 mid-terms that same morning).  Was due by 9 am, and went to his office after 6pm.\n\n2 days later in class he asks me to come to his office.  He returns it to me incomplete, because... it was late.  I told him I emailed him, and he told me he got the email, but I needed to let him know even further in advance.  Apparently others had asked for extension as far as a month ahead of time.  I pointed out that's just people not even trying to get the work done.  How could I possibly know a month ahead of time I wouldn't have my work done.. unless I knew I was going to procrastinate on it?  Why not just give everyone an extended due date if he was giving extension that far out?  He didn't care, called me privileged and told me where he came from there was no such thing as late penalties.  That's that.\n\nEnded up going to another professor and he helped me go to the Dean to get my paper accepted (the school charter(?) clearly states work will be accepted past the due date with a late penalty, unless other wise stated... and my prof hadn't stated otherwise).  Inital Prof did not take it well, and he took off 20% a day and marked it 2 days late (despite the charter clearly stating 5% a day, and the paper was only a 'day' late)\n\nSo sometimes, they don't give a shit and are just dicks.",
