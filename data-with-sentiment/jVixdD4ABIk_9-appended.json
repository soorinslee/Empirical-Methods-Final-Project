I cannot remember where I read that, it was back when I learnt La Fille au cheveux de lin, during the peak of my obsession with French Impressionists. Lol my wild teenage years. I still adore Debussy, I've just branched out a bit with my piano repertoire. \ud83d\ude04",

The moment of pure bliss that a good piece of music gives you is something I haven't felt in years, and you shared these with me and countless others. A part from the comedic pleasure you guys give, after many, many videos, this is my absolute favourite. As it gave me the shivers, and more than one moment of musical enlightenment, just listening to classical masterpieces that otherwise I would never have heard. So thanks guys, thanks for sharing your passion and appreciation.\nLove yah, and hope you keep doing what ya've been doing, with my absolute support.",
