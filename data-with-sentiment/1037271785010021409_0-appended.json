If you manage to get really good at it, and learn some other language, like Python, you will never run out of job offers, even outside of game programming.\nIf you want a programming job, you'll need experience and good understanding of the language involved in the job. In art jobs, you need talent on top of that. You really have to prove you are a cut above the rest and have a \"vision\". I have a few friends that did art related degrees, now struggling to find jobs, or are working in something completely different.\nI started studying programming around 10 years ago and I still don't get it. I did a sound and music related degree and tried to get a job in game audio. All jobs I found required 2 years+ experience at entry level, be great at coding in C++ and other languages and have experience with other software, and have a banger portfolio. I haven't studied any of these, except some C++, and don't have the patience to build a portfolio that won't help me pay the bills in the immediate future.\nSorry if this turned into a rant, but hope it gives you an idea of why doing coding is better if you're good at it",
