Take for example Tom's Macdonald MVs, wholly made by one person (Tom's girlfriend Nova Rockafeller) - they are really low budget and minimalistic but interesting to watch. It just skills and knowing your job, not money that make good MVs.",

Even if it's just a slow pan from here to there. Even the slow jam music videos are still put yogether in a way that makes uou want to know what's next. Before your videos (I came here because of Itzy and Stray Kids) I didn't care much about music videos except to see the artists I like and what ideas they had for the music video. Idc for this song so Idc for thr music video \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640 (more so indifferent because I don't hate it incase anyone rrads it that way). A music video I liked that had 13799737 artists in one song is the Touch It [bring it back, watch it, turn it, leave it, stop FORMAT IT] remix (Busta Rhymes).\n\n\nAlso you dancing to mimick what's happening in the video\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

It's a nice song to vibe to while doing ___. The mv was as expected though, they're not as artistic and on a lower budget. So I understand that uhm gr- we don't speak of that shot.",
