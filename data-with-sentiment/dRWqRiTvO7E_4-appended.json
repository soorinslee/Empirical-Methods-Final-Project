I attribute this to one main thing I learned from my parents. When a problem arises, you deal with it IMMEDIATELY. Nip it, confront it and take appropriate actions. I watched so many other parents vacillate and issues grew worse. This is no different. As a matter of fact this delay in action is pathetically weak. We should not, as citizens, have to wait and wonder whether DOJ or committee has enough common sense to read the situation correctly and act with the diligence required to achieve the desired outcome of Justice. For the love of God, they need to grow up and do their damn jobs.",
