They don't abuse their hamsters (Hamsterious owner)   2. They run the course everyday (The owner of Hamsterious told me that)    3. They do not fight each other (I don't know but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't) 4. The Hamsters are trained obviously and they do not (Hamsterious owner) put them in the same courses of everything and when the owner of Hamsterious does  they just chill they don't fight . So you guys need to stop trying to say Hamsterious is a bad person Hamsterious is just making us little funny cute videos of the Hamsters they have, I think it's wrong you guys hate for no reason",
