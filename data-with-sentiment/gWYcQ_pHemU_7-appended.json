It's about school choice and sexual material etc being thrown at kids when too young etc. If the focus on education is just on 'critical race theory', sooner or later it's going to make black voters think 'Are we in agreement here to walk together on the subject of education or critical race theory'. If it's education being the priority, we have much in common, but if it's critical race theory, I don't like it, but there is much more that concerns me than that. It's important that 'critical race theory is not all that is talked about when it comes to education. Parents have made themselves clear that it is much more than 'critical race theory' that has bothered them by what they gave said in school governor's meetings. If this is now ignored and all that is discussed is 'critical race theory' they are soon going to feel they are not really being heard, but just being used for racial battles they  are less concerned about and that risk splitting them on racial lines. What brings them together is education and the control they have on what their children are taught as they expressed in the meetings and protest. That's what keeps them together. Just focusing on critical race theory alone will soon make some feel marginalised by turning education and parents being in control of what their children are taught into a race issue.",
