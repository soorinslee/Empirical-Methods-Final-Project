            "body": "Seems like nonsense. The federal government  has constitutional jurisdiction over interstate commerce. It controls its own contracts through the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which is where the COVID Executive Order largely manifests. Another portion of the Executive Order flows through OSHA, which has its own jurisdiction superceding that of any state.\n\nThe FAR have controlled federal contracts since 1984, with predecessor regulations dating back to 1947. Case law around the FAR is voluminous, but to my knowledge no court has ever found that the FAR can be overturned by a state - the federal government's interest in its own contracts and in maintaining a level playing field is compelling. Even if a specific, required FAR clause (like the COVID mandate) is left out of a contract, courts have consistently ruled that it is deemed to be part of the contract anyway. You can't weasel your way out. \n\nI haven't read the states' filings and don't plan to, but it seems likely they'd have to plead either against the FAR's authority (very unlikely to succeed) or some constitutional overreach by the Executive Order. Since the president has authority over Federal regulations, his authority is clear. They might question the president's judgment, but that's a dead letter: he's the president. If the country doesn't like a president's decisions it has political remedies: pass legislation, elect a new president, impeach and convict. Courts are not the remedy for politics, as 60 courts recently demonstrated by refusing to countenance baseless, partisan voter fraud filings. Since no court is going to step into lawful presidential orders simply on their merits, these states would have to demonstrate a clear constitutional breach. Protecting the health of federal employees and the employees of federal contractors is a compelling federal interest that clearly falls within the president's powers, so it's unclear what breach is imagined.\n\nThere's also no basis to claim damages. If you don't want to adhere to applicable FAR you don't have to. You don't get to be a federal contractor, or a subcontractor to a federal contractor, at any tier - but that is not harm. Since every other federal contractor or bidder for a federal contract must follow the same FAR, the playing field is level, *ergo*,  you have not been harmed and cannot claim to be.\n\nSource: not a lawyer,, Sourcing AVP for 20 years, Global Contract Manager for 15, our legal counsel &amp; I just drafted our company's compliance plan, which my department is implementing.\n\nJust more GQP grandstanding to rile up their base. I expect these lawsuits will go as far as the 60 election fraud lawsuits, where the only frauds found were in the legal arguments presented. This will further undermine confidence in our system of government - which is the real agenda.",
