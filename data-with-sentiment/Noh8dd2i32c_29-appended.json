I usually prefer a bolder color palette and like to put smaller rugs around the bed, usually one on each side. That way, I can appreciate the rugs in their entirety and they make more of a statement.",

I have hand sanitizer and a place for disinfecting my work pens and other things sitting there (I'm an RN). I currently have everything in a beautiful tray, but it just makes me sad to have to have that stuff sitting out. Is it better to change the bottle for the hand sanitizer to something more decorative? I'm just at a loss. Thank you.",

I don't know how else to describe it, but it basically has diagonal walls. (sorry english is not my native language). Thank you once again!",
