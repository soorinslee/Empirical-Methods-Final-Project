Russia, China and Iran are all neighbors with a strong interest in stabilizing the Taliban regime. Pakistan is a long standing Taliban supporter despite being a US ally (spoiler alert: they're not and never have been). But they have nothing to gain from opposing this new arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to have a brutal, torture and murder loving authoritarian regime. They could go on indefinitely until they collapse internally. Not likely to happen for decades to come.",
