Consuming without consciousness is what have us here, based on a logic of a literal poor mind where our fears are ruled by not having enough and to try to hold as much as we can to demonstrate to society our selfish needs by accumulating things like money, cars, houses, yachts, planes, humongous amounts of food and clothes we don't need. If you take a look at this doc very closely, the ones of us that live in cities are quite selfish and we don't stop to think what our impact will be for every unnecessary purchase, for every unnecessary accumulation to become \"someone in society\" when truly, our nature as species is to be united as one. Let's stop thinking our way of life doesn't affect everyone because it truly does. Let's start getting things because we truly need them and not to appear as someone in society when we are just feeding the greed of certain companies that want us to consume in an unlimited and disproportionate way. If you really want to be someone in society, have consciousness of every sister and brother around the world who is suffering because of our selfish acts.",
