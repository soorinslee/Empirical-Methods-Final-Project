So, from thereon, I've only ever checked the difficulty to make sure it's on default, or to slightly increase it in case the game was too easy/would not give the best ending.     \n\nI've still not reached the point of lowering the difficulty. There's nothing wrong with it, and I don't look down on others for doing so, but... I feel like I'm missing out on something if I decrease the difficulty from the default. Like, this wasn't how the game was meant to be played. It's got nothing to do with pride, honestly.
