I have a VERY COOL undertone & I get really tan in the summer. And their TruBlend line is absolute perfection I\u2019ve never gotten a better shade match. The original formula (not matte) reminds me big time of the WnW Tinted Hydrator too which I also love.",

It's not that we are not pretty without make up but, despite the face creams and care we do, make up just instabtly transforms that 37 yro skin in such a satisfying way. I even remember being a kid and wanting to get into my mom's make up bag. She used to tell me \"One day you will really need this stuff. Now you are just perfect the way you are!\" Nostalgia.....",

It would be fun to see you do a more modern interpretation of what that girl from high school wore, especially as I\u2019m sure you could make it wearable.  It\u2019s also fun to look back and realize that stuff like the Scooby Doo movie was painfully accurate to the awkward style of the time, so a modern interpretation from someone who lived it would be a lot of fun.",
