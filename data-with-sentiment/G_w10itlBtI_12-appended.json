(Hot glue) around the drawer bottom underneath the drawer so no one would ever see it. And it'll not only hold the loose bottom in place. But it'll keep the bottom from rattling around if the glue up wasn't tight enough and/or didn't hold properly. Just a thought. I sometimes do that after pin nailing the bottom without wood glue. It just makes the drawer building process a bit quicker. I just got done building 5 drawers for my shop and a cabinet to hold them. And I've gotta pick up another sheet of plywood, because the other half the cabinet with house 8 or 10 more drawers.\n\nAlso I think the black pulls look good. But both are awesome.",

I don't know how the software for the CNC you have works but for Blum undermount slides, cut out your sides with grooves (make sure your front and back panel are tall from the groove to the top of the drawer) and then just make the box with sides and front/back and clamp it together then just slide in the bottom and nail it in to the back and front. that makes your drawer perfectly square and you don't even have to check it if you drawer bottom is tightly in place.",
