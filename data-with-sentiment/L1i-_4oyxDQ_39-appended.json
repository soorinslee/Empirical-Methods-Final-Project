But I really like how your piece is modern, but with almost a grunge feel!  It gives it so much charter.  I\u2019ve washed tons of different colors, I usually lean towards gray washes, but now I most definitely have to try black!  Whenever I\u2019ve \u201cwashed\u201d a piece and need a black color, I\u2019ve always used pitch black glaze by GF and I love love love it, but it\u2019s not quite the same look.  So goodwill here I come to find the perfect piece to try this out!  Thanks for sharing all your amazing creations!",
