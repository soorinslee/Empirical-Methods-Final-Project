It really does help as they have the experience to ask the right questions to help you realise why you're so hard on yourself and how to build up your confidence and dig yourself out of that hole. \n\nYou need to be really open to it though. Therapy is only effective if you're willing to be honest with yourself. This type of self-reflection journey is often rough and painful, but when you come out the other side, it's wonderful.",

I recommend you take a look at the body dysmorphia section too, and see if any of it seems similar to your experience. You may have flaws, but you may also be so focused on the flaws that fixing them will only give you temporary relief, because you will begin to fixate on the next flaw once the first one is remedied. Your pain is real, and you have a right to take steps to improve your appearance to feel more confident. Sometimes it really is the flaw holding you back, and after it\u2019s fixed, you feel great long term. If you improve your appearance but still feel this intense anxiety, and think every look means someone noticed your flaws, I would recommend working with a counselor who understands body dysmorphia. \n\nOnce you are out of school, life gets easier. You\u2019ll have more control of who you spend time with. You won\u2019t be stuck in a building with bullies anymore. And, you never have to see any of these people again after graduating. Keep in mind that if a bully knows your insecurities, they will pick on you for it, even if they don\u2019t really see your flaws themselves or really think the flaw is a big deal. Their goal is to hurt you, so they\u2019ll say whatever hurts the most, even if they don\u2019t believe it themselves.\n\nDo your parents realize the agony this is causing you? Do they know you are crying in the bathroom? I would tell them these things, if you haven\u2019t already. Do they disagree with you about the severity of your flaws? This might be a clue that your perspective might be distorted. Would they let you consult with an esthetician to see what her opinion is, and to explore age-appropriate or lower-cost options?",

If you are feeling down on yourself in your own right, there are a few things you can do to help build self esteem. First, find things you like to do and do them!

When I was in high school I was considered bubbly and very confident, and it was 100% fake. On the inside I was super shy, introverted, and thought all the bad things about myself, and I probably would have stayed that way were it not for the fateful day I ditched school and missed the city bus back home. I ended up talking to some old woman about all sorts of things (I was about 14) and one of the things that stuck with me was the \u201cFake it till you make it\u201d thing. \n\nAt home and in privacy I worked on myself, because like you I was super sensitive. The wrong look and BAM tears. I hated it so much. So at home without anyone looking at me, or making fun at me, I could just work on my self esteem and anything else I wanted to improve. \n\nIn the real world I had to fake it. I didn\u2019t want to be miserable shy mess in public, so I pretended to be so much more put together than I was. \n\nIt worked. \n\nIt took a long time but eventually the faking of confidence showed me things I could only see by putting my shyness and low self esteem aside. Eventually the confidence stayed. It\u2019s about perspective with confidence but again that won\u2019t make sense until it does. \n\nThis is what worked for me in my teenage days, I hope it helps you! And whether you are ugly, pretty, weird, it doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re the only you that you\u2019ve got so you may as well enjoy the ride.",

Trust me, been there!\n\nThe best advice I can give you is going to sound pretty harsh, but when you think people are looking at you and judging you etc, they probably are, but not for very long. They don\u2019t go home and dwell on it, you are just a side character in the shit show that is there life, same way they are a side character in yours. \n\nYou might think you are ugly or fat or whatever, but I promise you, you\u2019re worst critic is you. \n\nSchool can be vicious, people can be dicks. You be you and screw anyone who tries to tell you otherwise. \n\nAll of this sounds great, but it is going to be hard to implement. Just think about how long you judge others shortcomings and apply that thought process in reverse. \n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "Hi, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way. Many times, peoples thoughts of others are reflections of themselves. Even the most conventionally attractive people have those who will find something about them to bash on. The important thing to remember is that they have no bearing on the person you actually are. If you are feeling down on yourself in your own right, there are a few things you can do to help build self esteem. First, find things you like to do and do them! You will meet like minded people this way, and having friends who care about you and support you is a big help when considering your mental well-being. You might also get very good at these things, and having a skill l, or something you\u2019re good at, will allow you a sense of pride in the work that you put in. Do things to improve upon yourself. Exercise is a great place to start. It will give you a sense of purpose, an improved mental state, and you may even improve your looks from doing so (this shouldn\u2019t be your sole focus, but it\u2019s a nice side effect. Who doesn\u2019t like to be in shape?). Also, realize that your school aged years are a temporary part of life, and while it can be a very difficult time, as kids can be pretty brutal to one another, it won\u2019t always be this way. Focus on your strengths. You must have things you consider your strengths, so spend more time thinking about them, and focus less on what you perceive as your shortcomings. If you do feel your thoughts drifting towards a negative place, use that as a source of motivation, rather than allowing it to def you down. I hope this advice helps, even a little bit, and I hope that you realize that you are valuable and loved, and even if you don\u2019t think so at times, that you have a very bright life ahead of you, if you allow yourself to it.",
