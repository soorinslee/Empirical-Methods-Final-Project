My husband is on a heart diet and can't eat alot of dark greens. This time of year he REALLY craves sweets. He does eat fresh fruits but still wants the whole pumpkin pie and will eat a batch of cookies in a couple days. I find making smaller batches help but most the ingredients I don't approve. Sorry this is so long.",
