There were some pretty long days and weeks where I was very unproductive, I started putting in weight, and I\u2019d stare out the window and think about how nice it looked outside but would not leave the house.\n\nEven if you go for a 10 minute walk outside it makes a huge difference to your mental health. If you\u2019re feeling depressed or unhappy or even just having a blah day, a short walk does help make you feel lighter and less closed-in. I was beginning to feel sad this afternoon so I forced myself to walk over to the golf course, and sit by the large pond and talk to the ducks.

If I have friends or family along with me to devote the majority of my focus then those thoughts don\u2019t trouble me, but in the absence of company, walks just don\u2019t feel like a positive activity.\n\nSpecifically regarding seasonal depression: I haven\u2019t heard of others feeling this way, but rather than a lack of sunlight, mine is triggered by feeling too cold! I feel *miserable* when I\u2019m cold. Bad circulation means that just bundling up doesn\u2019t fix it, either (plus wearing tons of layers? Maybe it\u2019s an unpopular opinion, but I do NOT find that comfortable).

I'm not officially diagnosed as having the seasonal affective disorder, but I have noticed if I'm able to stick to a daily schedule when I get the most sun exposure, then I actually do better overall.   I did this while I was home, unemployed and waiting for my union job to call me back.\n\nProblem is, I'm back at work now, and I'm forced to move to a 2:30 pm start time with an 11:30 pm end time.  In order to properly balance my medications and the sleep schedule I've tried to keep to make sure they weren't a hindrance during my waking hours, I will have to sleep until noon to make sure I have enough energy to work.  This is all going against my doctor's recommendations that I provided months ago that said I need to prioritize a \"daytime\" schedule; and even though I'm in a union, my company is fighting the doctor's note because he never specified an actual time on the two notes he's already provided, just a \"daytime\" schedule.  So, I'm working on this schedule until I see him again in two weeks to explain the new issue.  By which time, I will add, the clocks will have changed, and it will start to get dark around 5 pm where I am. \n\nMy chest has been hurting from the anxiety for the past two days.  I can't quit, because it's a full-time job and union - the job security that I have will never be replicated and I just can't leave for something that's merely advertising a possibility of full-time.  \n\nI don't know what to do anymore.",
