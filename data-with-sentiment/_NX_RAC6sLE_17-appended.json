The phrase with the high note \"Blew me away!\" JK's lower register is stunningly equisite!! His English pronunciation is stellar.   I want more! I need more! Trivia...Big Hit sent young JK to train in hip-hop dancing in L.A. He came back so enthusiastic that he told Jimin he wanted to quit BTS and become a  full time dancer. Luckily, Jimin talked him out of it! JK said in an interview he had NO idea that he would become the main lead vocalist. He had no confidence in his voice. And now....we are here! JK the best male soloist in the world!",
