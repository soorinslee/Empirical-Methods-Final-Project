In our geological history we have seen the Earth warm to up to 8 degrees higher than today, during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, where the world was much hotter and had much more carbon in the air. While we saw sea life diminish during this time, we also saw the rise of animals like Titanaboa (largest snake ever), this era was much hotter but life on land looked more like Florida with rainforests all over the world including Antarctica. Our world will always change but 3 degrees difference will NOT be an armageddon scenario!",
