Why should any man risk something for a woman who has nothing to do with him? As men we are all described as evil and toxic human beings in our modern world. According to mainstream media women can do anything men can and even far better. So the question should really be, where were all those strong and independent women who are more competent and more powerful than any man?? I would never help a woman I don't personally know, to avoid any claims of unwanted attention and what not. You Go Girl and fight for yourself.",
