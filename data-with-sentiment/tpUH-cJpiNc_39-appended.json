Shopping, partying, makeup are short-lived pleasures that do not add to a human being's purpose on this planet. You come across as a sensible kid, as does Shane - but you are lost in this make-believe world of pleasure. Do find your way back and work for a meaningful cause. Sending good vibes your way.\n\nAlso, all the commenters who are celebrating your lifestyle are doing you a disservice. This is not a life worth emulating. Work for a noble cause, it will help others and it will help you. Plus you can do it!",
