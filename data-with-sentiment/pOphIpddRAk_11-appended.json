I have personally seen a  big executive came from the UK stayed in TAJ WESTEND  for RS  100000/- day class suit and tells us how to save cost.  We held our quality conference in the cafeteria to save on hotel costs with the same guy who came in  BMW  rented car from  TAJ WESTEND.  People notice all these things very well.  Those very few executive class people have a passion for elephant ride and the company arranges for that. They want to visit the racecourse and the company arranges for that.  This is happening in front of us..  a large section of people are slogging day in day out for that  Salary coming at the end.  pandemic  showed us  there is other side to life  and   hence  people  are  quitting",
