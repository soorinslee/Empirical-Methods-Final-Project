It's all a prelude to fascism and a dictatorship. Read history.  What the republicans have done the last 5 years and are doing is from a playbook they play page after page, alinea after alinea and word after word.

In a sense this is also true for big portion of the US population.  Since there is almost no one who can tell you please read the history books or  watch a documentary about it.  And look around you to countries that has become or are becoming a dictatorship.",
