Keep requesting removal from EACH name/address variation you receive until they stop completely. You see marketing companies use the name/address variations found in databases like truepeoplesearch - which this info is provided to them by the credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion &amp; Innovis), USPS, public records (ex. Property records, DMV records, voter registration records and other sources as well.\n\nJust be extreme diligent and remove your name/address variations from EVERY known database, marketing company, etc.\n\nSee my steps on how to accomplish this task!",
