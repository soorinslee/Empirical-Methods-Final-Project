I absolutely am obsessed with my linen, I use a top sheet as well, the majority is white. Plus, I iron the top sheet every day when I make the bed!!!!!  Crazy I know but it's lovely getting into a fresh bed every night, and not into wrinkled bedding.\nBut the saddest thing is that I am on my own and the left side of my bed has never been slept in!!!!
