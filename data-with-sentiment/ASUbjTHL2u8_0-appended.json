That's probably a good reason as to why it's vaulted too. They're probably going to have to rework it so that the flyers start after round 1 and they grab death boxes from the map and carry them around, or the first few can drop the death boxes of the team the champion killed.. like when they introduce the champion, somewhere on kc there is 2-3 flyers with the same loot the 2nd place team had at the end of the champion's last match, and the deathbox can lead you to the champion if you're Ash.  The flyers will spawn wherever is the least populated part of the map once everyone's feet are on the ground off drop.",
