Fox news sounds very upset about the Lincoln Project taking a picture of some guys with tiki torches standing in front of the Youngkin bus.\n\n&gt; \"Anyone who continues to associate themselves with The Lincoln Project owns this. This is who you are,\" Fourth Watch media critic Stever Krakauer wrote. \n\nOh, Steve Krakauer sounds *very upset* about this P.R. stunt. He hates it when someone messes with a campaign bus.\n\nUnless it's bumpkins with rifles on a Trump Train attacking a Biden bus in Texas and the  San Marcos police don't help, they just laugh about it. That seems within the realm of acceptable behavior around other people's buses.",
