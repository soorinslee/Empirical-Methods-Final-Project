What does 6 degrees feel like? \n\nWhat do the 50 thousand children a year who die of Rabies feel like? \n\nWhat was it like living in Greenland, (the clue is in the name) when the Vikings farmed it with cattle and vinyards grew just south of Edinburgh? \n\nWhat's it like living with White narcissists, who know that the demographics are firmly against them; and imagine that instead of their own extinction, it is the (white) Polar Bear and the whole world that is facing extinction. \n\nSorry folks, the Earth is not flat. \nWe are on a planet spinning on its axis at 1,000 miles per hour and hurtling through space at 67,000 miles per hour, in orbit around a star whose radiation is not constant and you worry about an increase in levels of CO2 of 100 parts per million?",
