Lucario just took such an ridiculous amount of damage what also made it look incredibly weak in random moments, like when it just stood there and took the sky attack, whiel before that it had a dragonball-esque brawl mid air with Hawlucha.\nIt also looked weird how Ash went repeatedly for the Force Palm without showing us any way how that could have potentially worked.\nIt made it look like Force Palm and Aura Sphere are the only moves Ash is aware of that Lucario can use.\n\nThe worst part about it is that I honestly can't feel pressured about the fight anymore. Lucario already has taken so much damage that I can't estimate what would be too much for it. I cannot just assume that the next cross shop would actually take it down or the next 10 cross chops and 1000 bullet punches...",
