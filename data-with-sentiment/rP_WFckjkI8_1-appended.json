I'd prefer something the size of the RG351MP or smaller ( Like the RG280V ).  Something that can fit in my pocket, and easy to take to work with me.  This and other companies are trying to make their new emulators look like the switch, which is just too large for my interests.   At these sizes, I'd rather just get a Steam Deck ( well, IF I could get one. Those will be hard to get for a while ).  And with my Launch day switch hacked, I have no need for anything nearing the size of the switch ( except for the steam deck ).  I could just take my switch to work with me.  \n\nBut that's just me.  If being able to carry thousands of games in my pocket means I don't get absolute perfect aspect ratio's...That's a trade-off I'm willing to make.  Also, smaller screens use less power.  So a bigger screen = bigger battery = more weight.  \n\nI hope some of these companies that are trying to make crazy small emulators that are too small to practically use, would make their units bigger, but with more modern hardware. For me, something in between the size of the Gameboy Micro and the RG351MP would be perfect.  I wish Anbernic would make an updated 280V, with slightly newer hardware.",
