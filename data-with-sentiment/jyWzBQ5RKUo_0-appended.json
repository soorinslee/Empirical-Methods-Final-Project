At the time it came out, I had an inner anger towards the world, but especially the treatment I had received from my caseworker in the municipality. I had lost both my parents a few days apart a few years before and I didn't have had my grief treated. My whole world collapsed .... how would my future be .... I have never reacted violently because I was \"so good\" at hiding my anger from the outside ..... but deep down, I had a strong feeling of doing something drastic ...... but my sense of reason had taken over ..... so my anger was locked inside me ..... which I am sure was the reason I went down with depression. Therefore, this song was the reason I could find energy to keep the deepest depression away for periods. :)",
