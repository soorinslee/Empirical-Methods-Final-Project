I believe I build it exactly in my own survival game, but it seems that I can't get the pulse like you do...does anybody have a more detailed explantion, so I can get it working?\n\nEDIT:  how many items do you need in the hopper? It seems that my comparator cannot read the the items inside of the hopper correctly to send a pulse. I do appreciate anyones help :)!",
