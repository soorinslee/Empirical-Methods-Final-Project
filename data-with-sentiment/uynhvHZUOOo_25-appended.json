The world has cycles as it has since it\u2019s start, there\u2019s a graph showing weather patterns (caused by these cycles) starting from in the hundreds of thousands to present day. It even shows interruptions where the earth has suffered big catastrophe\u2019s ie around 11600 years ago we suffered a strike by a large meteor or comet and this shows up on the graph by an 18c jump in global temperatures, its thought to be what ended the last ice age. The scientists drilled down something like 2 miles into the Greenland ice cap over 5 years and this is what they\u2019ve found by studying the layers of the core samples. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re going to stop from happening. We still do need to live cleaner and look after the planet a lot more than we do for lots of reason but we won\u2019t have an effect on the cycles of the earth, and I believe that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing. have a look into it!\n\n JR podcast had one with a guy called Randall Carlson he\u2019s brilliant.
