Anyone who just wants one and only only fragrance all year round for everything should definitely try it. Ultimate versatility, one of the most easy to wear, never wrong, likeable, least offensive clean fragrances of all time.\nBy the way even if called Mugler Cologne Come Together now, in Spain I've seen the 300ml bottles back in stores. Here in Germany I have not seen those yet though, unfortunately. Online it can be purchased for around \u20ac60, that brings its cost per ml to one of the best values among all fragrances, even beating many/most cheapies.",
