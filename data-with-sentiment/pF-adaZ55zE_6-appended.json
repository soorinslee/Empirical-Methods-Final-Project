I like the eye look you did here but those cheapo plastic packaging is such a turn off because l know it will crack or break in a week. Dont know what the price is on that palette but l would think between $10 to $15. That Milani blush is also a no for me for the same reason. I think you applied a bit too much blush here, but l realize your doing 2 palettes. Lipstick was also not great. Seen so much better looks on you, but glad your mom is doing better.",
