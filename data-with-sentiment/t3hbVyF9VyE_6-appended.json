The 1st Mar Div fights the US battles today with success and honor.\nSouth Korea is a successful and prosperous country.\nNorth Korea is poor dark at night and had nuclear we a Pons thanks to china and Pakistan.\nThe Chinese tactics in Korea were not after the initial surprise particularly successful and were wasteful of their soldiers lives. These soldiers were poorly equipped for the weather and suffer greatly from freezing to death and frostbite.\nAnd THAT is more or less a summary of the Korean War and the outcome.\nFrom the Chinese standpoint it's hardly the stuff of which legends are made although their individual soldiers were cert as only brave enough.",
