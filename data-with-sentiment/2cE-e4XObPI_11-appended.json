Sorry but no one enlightened me how those scars should be look at. How and why those scars where there. After I had my girl I have this massive battlescars all over my tummy. I used to cry at night looking back how I see myself, how horrible I look and feel. But everytime I look at my child, I understand why I have this, why it shouldn't be ashamed of, why it should be normalised. Let us be the one to educate our children that this won't make her/him less beautiful. In the first place your genetics is a big factor. Even those Super Models have their own stretch marks. \ud83d\udc9a",
