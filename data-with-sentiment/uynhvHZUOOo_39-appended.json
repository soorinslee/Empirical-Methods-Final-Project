            "comment": "Disappointing. The two big complaints are due to their focus on the direct impacts from the environment over the next eighty years.\n\nFirst, they miss the feedback loops that the gradually escalating interim crises will create. As rich countries are called upon for aid by their citizens, they'll be less likely to help poorer countries (witness the lack of COVID vaccines going to the poorest countries), or even cooperate with other wealthy countries (beyond lip service \u2014 already evident at climate summits). The economic disruption will accelerate as the climate crisis becomes more and more evident, reducing the likelihood that anything ever gets done.\n\nSecond, by pointing to the 3\u00b0C increase at the end of the century, they make it easy for people to treat this like a horror story that will maybe happen to strangers. \u201cThat's a long time from now, surely someone will fix the problem well before then.\u201d They should be pointing to the unprecedented flooding in Germany, the unprecedented heat wave in Australia, the melting of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia, the fires in the U.S. west \u2014 all happening now, and all harbingers of worse to come. People need to be scared about their own futures, not that of their grandchildren's.",
