When being interviewed, I explain to them the reason for quitting my current job is for me to have a work-life balance, they straight away reject me. Maybe companies still need people who flog themselves to work for long hours, maybe there's something lacking in me too. But as far as I know, smaller manufacturing sectors never pay attention to their employee's health (be it mental or physical). All they need is their system to go on as they want to. They need to understand that working for long hours wouldn't increase one's productivity, but instead decrease their ability to compete in the fast paced technological world.",

Why are the cargo ships not being unloaded for real? \" Motha truckers\"say there is no trucker storage. How much of what she said is actually true? Worldwide quiting? Why the plandemic? Who's really behind defunding police?  Why all the racial confrontations & rioting BLM? Pitting us against each other. Abolish 2nd amendment? Why all of this at once? A lot has happened in the past 2 yrs I'm not a conspiracy theorist but It just seems like we're being played.. Once you're dependant on the government or any  entity they then control the dice. Personally, i feel the endplay is control. Here' a thought: how do you know for sure people are quiting their jobs internationally for real. No way to confirm it. All we have is the news telling us this.",
