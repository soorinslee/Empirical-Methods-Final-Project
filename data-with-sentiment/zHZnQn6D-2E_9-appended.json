My goodness Xico take care of yourself aww poor man sending HUGS and well wishes you are already most of the time missed by us. Is this student housing the reason for the no paint no holes thing? I would have turned the bed around though away from the door if poss so head is not at the door. I agree with you no Christmas pillows. Did you make the peel and stick wallpaper with the Cricut? you didn't suggest a sofa bed for space as would allow for more space in apartment with bed and sofa together. I too use dining chair as desk chair it's fine just after first year add some padding or cushion on seat is fine.",
