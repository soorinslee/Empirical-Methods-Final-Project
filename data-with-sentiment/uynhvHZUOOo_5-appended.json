For example, the comparison is made between getting on a plane with a 1 in 20 chance of crashing, and going forward with a 1 in 20 chance of temperatures rising an average of 3C. THIS IS A FALSE ANALOGY. The global population will be far better equipped to deal with a 3C rise over 80 years than 300 passengers in a 5 second airline crash.\n\nAnd then there are the interviews with a random selection of poor people who try to deal with environmental challenges that millions have done before them. \n\nPoor form, Economist!",
