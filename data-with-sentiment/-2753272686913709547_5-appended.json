It is like saying \"when I need my transport needs met, saying 'efficient' will get my stuff transported faster or else the transport people just transport it the way they want\". This does not really make sense since transportation is such a general term. Do you want to have parcels delivered overnight or are you hauling crude oil in a tanker? Likewise, IT comprises such diverse sub fields as installing a cartridge in a printer, to developing search algorithms for google, to training machine learning models in self driving cars, to designing robots.\n\nAs a software developer I have a few counter tips to you: 1. IT is not magic, you can actually learn how it works and this will greatly enhance the interactions you will have with \"IT people\" in the future. 2. \"IT people\" are, believe it or not,  actual human beings too. You should definitely try to have a normal conversation with them instead of manipulating them with magic words.\n\nGood luck!",
