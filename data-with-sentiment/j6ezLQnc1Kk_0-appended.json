Yes, voting is important, but we need to invigorate and rectify the Democratic Party politicians, the Democratic party voters, the media and the Department of Justice. I am not sure how we can do this, but we must try. In their present state, these entities will just allow the fascists to steam-roll us. Look at the news. \n They are allowing it even as we speak. Gallego mentioned something about \"...they don't care about democracy. As long as they keep getting their fat tax breaks and deregulation\" (I'm para-phrasing). Are the politicians in the Democratic Party secretly hoping that the coup is finally successful in 2022, so that their profit margin from stocks and shares increases?",
