He gets both Pikachu and lucario to close in multiple times despite both of them getting trapped in the past going against her\nI didn't like how lucario was being used here. He's being used to fight 3 Pok\u00e9mon in a row despite supposedly being the ace in the fight for mega evolution. Against valkner it was fine because gengar was down and Pikachu had to save more energy for later on. You would think he'd use lucario a bit less for the battle until came down against dynamax.",
