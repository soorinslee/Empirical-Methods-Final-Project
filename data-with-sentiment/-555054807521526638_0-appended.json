Has to be behind closed doors because they are doing things anybody should be ashamed of, or outright crimes.\n\nRepublican hypocrites want to reproduce the horrible Chinese and Russian 1-party system in America. So they can stay in office forever and remain corrupt and only beholden to their big-business donor corrupters. The will allow the richest to effectively enslave the rest of us.\n\nTrump's January pardons went to corrupt Republican politicians, not actual patriots. He wants 1-party rule, and doesn't care even the slightest about America or its interests.",
