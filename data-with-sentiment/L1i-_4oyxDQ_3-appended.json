Jeez.\" Thank goodness I was so wrong. After it dried and you sealed it... voila, it looks sooo expensive. This wash thing is pretty cool. I watched you do a white piece, I liked it best. But if I had extra money right now, I definitely make you an offer on this. It's gonna sell here in Nashville so quickly. Looks great, on trend, and solid wood. One of your best pieces. I wish you would do an end of year compilation of all your favorite pieces. Cost, time, selling price, days it took to sell, techniques, etc. I'm curious what you liked best, plus it'd be great content. All the best. \ud83d\ude42",
