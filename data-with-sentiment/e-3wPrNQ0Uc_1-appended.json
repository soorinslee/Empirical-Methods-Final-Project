I'm sure some MAGA members would love to copy the system (of time travel) and some are already trying (voting suppression, banning abortion for all cases, etc)\n\nIn Afghanistan, women are forbidden to go back to university (as students or workers), to work without permission of the male leader of the family, to go out the streets or someone's home without a male chaperon. In many cases they have to go back to a known (terrible) oppression system... in the case of the young people they have to learn how to behave in this (old) new system of oppression after living in a society where they could express (with discretion) their own believes and opinions.\nIn my opinion this situation proves that the USA wasn't doing much in the place other that taking... The kind of change needed in the region must come from within but the US had been telling its citizens they were there to provide assistance to the region and justifying your presence that way... And in 20 years the country didn't build a stable social/political/religious change to avoid exactly what is happening now.",

Because of how chaotic and conflicted as the Republican party is now and how weak the Democrat party is, would you say it's more likely that the Republicans implode and defeat themselves before the Democrat party does? I know this sounds like wishful thinking but then, it's not reasonable just to reject a possibility because it's the preferred outcome. I guess I can see a future where that could happen because of all the turbulence in the GOP.",
