Commie China lost over 500 of 5,000 strong regiment of pure MAO TSE TUNG lunatics & fanatics lost their lives as they tried to break through this ridge under the responsibility of 900 highly inspired, motivated, dedicated U.S. Ally in Asia & the Pacific, the PHILIPPINE Military. The Filipinos loss was miraculously small - 12! The Philippines wanted to make sure, the commie NPA in the Philippines are DEMORALIZED by the huge loss of their commie idol - Communist China! So the Philippines took the fight, along with the U.S. led U.N.  forces, to KOREA. \nThe second battle routed the chicoms back to the border with their tails tucked between their legs as they encountered  another Filipino Army & AMERICAN units in the Hill Erie sector. U.S. lost 8, & Filipinos lost 25 troops, Commie China lost over 1,631 U.N. estimated.",
