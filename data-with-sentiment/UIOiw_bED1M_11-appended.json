Whoever thinks this PS4 game cannot run in new consoles in 60/1440p is simply deluded. Its all a matter of optimization. Eidos Montreal simply threw the modes in there and did not bother to optimize the code, rather than cut whatever is needed in order to play smoothly in 60. Now the usual PC elitist who is used to brute forcing poorly optimized games on his uber PC, will come here and tell us this is exactly how it is. That somehow, Guardians of the Galaxy and Eidos Montreal \"maxed out\" PS5 and XBSX. Because, clearly... which game looks better? Ratchet and Clank (or any PS5/XBX exclusive) in 60fps with Ray Tracing and featuring open world environments in higher resolution, or Guardians of the Galaxy... lol\nPS: This whole \"we cant have everything\" BS from DF is getting old. We dont need to have everything, but from having everything to this piss job Eidos Montreal did with the 60fps mode, there is a huge gap...",
