If you don't mind just a suggestion for French horn swag if you would hang those three ornaments right under the bow where the circle of the horn is . By doing this it'll make that part look a little filled since the bottom already has nice frosty greenery n those ornaments are covering it. Try it n I hope you'll like it too.",
