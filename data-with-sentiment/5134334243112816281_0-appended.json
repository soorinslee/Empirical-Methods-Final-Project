            "body": "\u201cThis is a desperate map from a desperate party,\u201d said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which coordinates redistricting for the GOP. He called it \u201cAmerica\u2019s most extreme gerrymander.\u201d\n\nKincaid is trying to suggest that there is something evil/under-handed/nefarious in the Illinois redistricting plan.  As if the new districts in Texas aren't bad. Don't know if the Texas maps are better or worse, but they're bad enough.  Most of the population growth in Texas came from increases in Hispanic and Black populations, but neither of the two new districts will have a majority of 'people of color'.\n\nInstead of pointing at extreme examples of this anti-democratic practice, how about going with a national law requiring that re-districting in *ALL STATES* be done by non-partisan commissions.  \n\nAt this point, the whole gerrymandering thing is like the nuclear arms race -- neither side can afford to let the other side get ahead.\n\nA bit of detail:\n\nTexas -- 47% voted Dem, Dems won 36% of House seats  \nIllinois -- 47% voted Rep, GOP won 28% of House seats  \nCalifornia -- 34% voted Rep, GOP won 21% of House seats  \nOhio -- 45% voted Dem, Dems won 25% of House seats  \nMaryland -- 32% voted Rep, GOP won 12.5% of House seats (1 of 8)  \nUtah -- 38% voted Dem, Dems won 0% of House seats (0 of 4)\n\nState office races are frequently as bad or worse (example, in IL, only 15% of State Senate seats went to the GOP).\n\nTo be clear, bi-partisan commissions are no panacea guaranteeing 'proportionate representation' -- see California where 15% of State Senate (3 of 20), 24% of State Assembly (19 of 79) went to GOP in 2020.\n\nBut they help reduce the us-vs-them rhetoric.",
