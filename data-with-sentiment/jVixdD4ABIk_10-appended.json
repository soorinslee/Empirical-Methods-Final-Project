It's part of the Roman Trilogy, but we listened to that particular piece. It's a 4 part piece, and it ranges from light and airy, to dark, to epic and heavy. It's brilliant. \nAlso, I've dabbled in Ravel's Quartet & Miroirs No. 3, \"Une Barque sur l'Ocean\". That's only a part of my favorite classical pieces, I can name a lot more than that. Love you guys, I've been a fan for quite some time now. You give classical musicians a breath of fresh air! Peace!",
