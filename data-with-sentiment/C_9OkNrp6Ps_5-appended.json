It is true that under English law if you make a statement, you can be sued for libel\\slander - and then the burden of proof that the statement was true lies with the defendant. Simply saying that \"you believe the statement to be true\" or that \"your friend believes this to be true\" is not enough - nor, in my opinion, should it be. You must show t to be true. - The alternative, again in my opinion, is the situation you have in the US where the \"Big Lie\" is so easily propagated and is in danger of destroying your democracy.\n\n Furthermore, using the Big Lie to pass voter restriction rights - plus partisan gerrymandering (neither of which would be possible in the UK - risks burying the truth  - and your democracy - under an avalanche of lies.\n\nAs a final point, with regard to your comments concerning English food. When was the last time you visited? Is this your opinion based on experience - or are you merely repeating \"opinions\" of other \"armchair\" critics? - I have travelled the world, live in Italy - have experienced food in America - and I can tell you unequivocally that the food in the UK is far better than in the US. (So when you say something is a \"fact\", please check your \"facts\" first.)",
