If they truly wanted to help they could use all that money they acquire and educate a large number of the world's female population to the level of the women of the EU or America.  Doing that would lower the birth rate ( i.e.  giving them choices other than motherhood as a career ), improve living standards, increase the economic prosperity of all the countries involved, and show the world that Islam is a modern religion that cares for the most vulnerable members of every society.  But, the leaders of the Middle East countries will ALWAYS choose spending money on their elite, male, ruling class rather than assisting the poor of the world.  Muhammad, during his lifetime and through his teachings, did more than any other human up to that time to advance women's rights and opportunities in the world.  But within only a couple of centuries of his death, corrupt and evil hearted men began the slow process of returning women to second class citizens of their countries.  I truly believe in my heart that if either Muhammad or Jesus were to see the way we have corrupted their teachings that they would weep and beg God to show us mercy.",

Spend those oceans of dollars for tree plantation. Not fancy dress, cars (of course not those electric cars), construct big buildings.
