I lived in Oman for 3 years, and it felt like heaven for me most of the time. But, I do remember three days in summer 2014 that were so hot that even I could not bear to be outside. It wasn't 50, but it was close. Everyone said it was very abnormal. Luckily, it only lasted for those three days. I never thought I would complain about heat. I hate the cold. But I would have treasured the cold during those three days of hellish heat in 2014:(",
