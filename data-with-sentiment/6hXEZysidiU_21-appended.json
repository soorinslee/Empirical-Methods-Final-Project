            "comment": "Before trying to know who or what God is, have we known who we are ?\nThat has been man's problem ? In the process of knowing God, we have created innumerable religions with all kinds of belief systems and commandments and millions of people have been slaughtered and massacred in the name of religion ! \n\nIn Hindu culture, seeking existential truths is the basis ; here it is full of  debates and discussions ; even the realised Spiritual Masters in this culture could only be a guide post  and it is for the spiritual aspirant to walk alone, throwing away all the crutches and realise existential truths for himself, by himself, unless such a one was already an highly exhalted soul needing just a nudge from his Master to reach his goal or becoming one without a second !",

As he note, it pass away rapidly.\nThe yogis here again experience anicha, dukkha, anatha. \nAs the yogis only\nsee the end of rising and the end of fallings in the breathing contemplation. \nHere the yogis when observed the form and shape of head body, legs, hands, abdomen become not clear and disappear.  Yogi cannot feel the body. Now yogi can only feel  motion. \n\n6. Bhaya Nana\nInsight knowledge of fear. \nFear of being stuck to being birth after birth and death. \nAs yogis continue to note and see rapid passing away of khanda of rupa and nama, the yogi think one's life can also pass away at any moment. This realization is the development of BHAYA nana. \n\n7. Adinava Nana\nInsight knowledge of Danger. \nYogi start to become wise knowing the danger if to stop vipasanna breath contemplation. He realise there is no other way but to continue vipasanna breath awareness. \nThe yogis upon reflecting to this khanda of rupa and nama are ceesealessly passing away, the yogis see danger and dukkha of having  body and the khandas. \n\n8. Nibbida Nana\nInsight knowledge of Disenchantment.\nThe yogis concious mind become bored with khanda of rupa and nama.The yogis \nare experience in the subject of noting breathing contemplation and yet he seem to think there is no more improvement. Yogis begin to feel uncertain and become weary. The yogis upon reflects on human form, realizes there is no escape if he continue to be uncertain. He reflect that he must not stop noting but to continue. \n\n9. Muncitu Kanyata Nana\nInsight knowledge of Desire for Deliverance. \nYogis at this state suddenly begin to desire seriously to be liberated from human birth where the 5 khanda exist and wishes to go to the place where there are no such phenomenor. The yogis while in vipasanna meditation see there is a way to escape. Having this insight means MUNCITU KAMYATA nana has developed.",
