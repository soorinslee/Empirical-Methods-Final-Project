Remember when trump made a viable threat that he could demise someone on any given street? To me who is a regular citizen of the United States of America that had people serve and die plus some of my own children currently servicing to protect those rights that I learn in 9th-grade civic class. I felt my own life was in danger. Right here in America. Listen the Forefathers are literally spinning in their graves, wondering about our generation, and I mean the Boomer, X-er, Y-s, Millennials, and future generation. They are spearheading the demise of the very foundation of America. It's a SAD day to see this continue. Maybe Queen Elizabeth will show mercy to the US when Our forefathers broke from her Ancestors. See how ridiculous that sounds, That is how the red party/Coates sound to me with the picking apart of the USA constitution. History lesson anyone?",
