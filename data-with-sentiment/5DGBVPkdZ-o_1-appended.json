Love is patient and not selfish, it is always the other half, where he/she is happy. The lines can break a heart but it can also heal a broken heart. Letting go is not always sad, letting go is a sign of maturity and true love. After all, we are here to love and be loved. You have to grow and love yourself first before loving others. \n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY NADINE\u2764 KEEP GROWING, GOING AND GLOWING\u2764\u2764\u2764",
