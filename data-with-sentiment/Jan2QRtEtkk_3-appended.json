Divorce statistics prove that marriage is almost guaranteed in being years of strife followed by having a man's life ripped out from under him.  Real men are telling women to be the independent equals they claim to be, and refusing to allow women to trap them into marriages that put a man at the mercy of a woman's fickle feelings, with his kids and everything he's built held hostage to make sure he capitulates to whatever she wants.  Feminists have succeeded in killing chivalry, romance, and men believing in an institution of marriage that has become nothing more than a method to rip off men.  As for protecting a woman, they are self-proclaimed equals who don't need protection against anyone.  Women defined the rules, so they shouldn't complain that men are following them.",
