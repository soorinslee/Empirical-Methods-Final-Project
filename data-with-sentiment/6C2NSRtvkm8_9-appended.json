If you hip fire, the gun\u2019s optics, if any cover a section of your right side, holding the gun tilt for this purpose is to switch the blind spot, but now, your aiming down the sights functionally, with the scope now resting on the left. Depending on the situation, you may favor doing so in right hand corridors or approaching enemies. Practically, holding the gun at a tilt alters the direction of recoil force, tilting the gun also sprays your ejected cartridges so you gotta be careful not to waterfall hot brass casings onto yourself. Doing this creates a horizontal sweep the urges your recoil bounce horizontally instead of vertically. Although not commonly used for normal combat situations due to there not usually being groupings of indiscriminate, undead targets. In standard combat scenarios you\u2019re taught to keep your grouping tight and on single targets, mag dump isn\u2019t standard op, whereas zombie training probly requires you to shoot a line of zombies with great speed. Multiple headshots for similarly tall targets, potentially.",
