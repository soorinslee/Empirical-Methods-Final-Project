His early works are very Chopin-esque, his middle age works are when Scriabin starts experimenting with harmonies and rhythm (his 4 and 5 sonata are just incredible), and lastly his late period is very idomatic in style. He writes \u201catonally\u201d but there is still coherent nature in each piece. \n\nAnother piece y\u2019all could check out is Rachmaninov\u2019s Vespers (All Nights Vigil). It is one of the most spectacular choir pieces out there and just oozes with beautiful harmonies.\n \nThese r just two I could think of off the top of my head but I hope some people enjoy this lol",
