So heed this my word: both of them are the gods Nara and Narayana, glorious in heaven. You yourself know what their valor and power represent. Unapproachable and invincible in battle, these two ancient sages, the best of all, cannot be defeated by anyone in the three worlds. Both of them also deserve the highest respect from all the gods and asuras, yaksas and rakshasas, gandharvas and people, kinnaras and snakes. ... \". (Mahabharata Chapter 219).",
