Iran plays host to millions of Afghan refugees  that have been going there since the Soviet Invasion.  Iran has plenty of problems they don't need more.   Ho Chi Minh ordered the invasion of Cambodia and overthrew his fellow Communist Pol Pot because the insanely murderous purging that went with the Khmer Rouge take over in Kampuchea (Cambodia) was creating a massive refugee flow that the newly reunified Vietnam could not handle so they used their military to wipe out the cause of that flow. Vietnam remained active for two decades stomping on the Khmer Rouge.  They were not all that careful how they did it, but they were effective, if you set aside the brief Chines invasion of Vietnam in 1979.\n\nDumbest fucking fact ever Vietnam is basically a military ally of the US today unofficially of course.  American warships dock and their crews take leave in Haiphong harbor, and American veterans of the Vietnam War are officially welcomed into the Veterans halls of the NVA and VC to eat and get drunk with the men they fought.  Take a look at Ho Chi Minh City's skyline from 1970 to today, jesus an outside observer could be forgiven for thinking the US won that war.",
