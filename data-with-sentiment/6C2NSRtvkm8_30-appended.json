Hadn't known that Barrett had neutered the perfection that was their semi-auto 50BMG rifle.\n\nM4 differences: lower is aftermarket, front sight/gas block is the triangle front sight on the actual M4, the game has an aftermarket pistol grip, an aftermarket stock, and if you're like me and your command denied you the ability to use PMAGs the Gen 3 PMAG. I do like the nice touch on the distinct definition on the magazine though. Identification of the mag's generation is easy.\n\nHadn't noticed the sort of M4 barrel profile on the M16, weird.",
