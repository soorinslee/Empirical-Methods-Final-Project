When you're working in the kitchen oftentimes your hands can get a bit \"dirty\" (grease, flour, or whatever you're working with) so when you go to open your doors/drawers  if you have to press in the middle of the drawers all the time you'll be leaving smudges and fingerprints. With pulls that stays contained to the pulls and will keep your cabinetry cleaner longer. \n\nThen depending on the black paint you use on your cabinetry, test to see how well that cleans before commiting! Kitchens get dirty, especially near your cooktop. Best of luck!",
