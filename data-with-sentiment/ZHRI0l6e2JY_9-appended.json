However, when she chose to change mediums, her canvas didn\u2019t grab me by the shoulder\u2019s and say\u2026that\u2019s it! Thanks so much for the post as we wait weekly for it\u2019s appearance!",

Funny how they said 'we see a lot of this kind of art' about Jim's painting because I feel like I see that style in every episode, a kind of blocky muddy colour thing that looks like it was painted in the 1930s-1960s. I like it but it's a bit old-hat to me now and frustrating that the judges tend to favour it. The wild card blew them all away, fantastic piece.",
