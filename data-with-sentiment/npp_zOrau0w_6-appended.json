I get really high naturally from the energies going on around right now. Wonderful and at times horrible to feel with no boundaries between humans, animals, nature, environments, and even time. Just know your not alone devine children, and you don't even need a phone to be connected. Even being alone, I'm very much so connected. On a different level than the internet. It's much more far out and interesting too!. Much love, the cover is very enjoyable for the timing  right now!",
