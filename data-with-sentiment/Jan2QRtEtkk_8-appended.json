I was counseled once by a female sergeant to not be so assertive in protecting my female counterparts. I agreed the women needed to be able to protect themselves, however I was refusing to stand by as an inmate was trying to take advantage of my partners. I was taught this as a young boy, I beat up two neighborhood boys that were picking on my three year old sister. My Mom and Dad praised me for my efforts and I didn't get in trouble. I would still some 60 years later defend my sister if she asks for my help. However my kids have seen me cry when I needed to, oh yes and admit when I am wrong, apologize and most of all, I know that I badly need Jesus Christ as my savior, this guy is not perfect nor will I be. It is okay to be tough when it is needed, but to hide your feelings is wrong. God gave men and woman the ability to cry on purpose. Thank You Laura for this video, ALL men and women need to watch this!!!",

They love and take care of their friends.  Everyone around them love and appreciate their \"Alpha\" attitude when it comes to doing anything.  They never say, \"I can't!\".  They always say, \"I got this!\".  My daughters are head over heals for them and when they look at my two boys, all I see in their eyes is admiration with pride.  I taught them that yelling only builds walls so they don't ever yell at their wives or friends.  They stay calm and have a real conversation with empathy with everyone.  They don't get involved in stupid things like Social Justice or gender conversations.  They usually just blow it off saying, \"good for you!\".  Then they walk away knowing that it is never going to be a conversation, just accusation.  They focus on important things like taking care of loved ones.  They work hard, they provide not only materialistic stuff but provide love with security.  My two boys are what everyone keeps saying are \"Evil\" and \"Disgusting\".  Well it what they are doing is evil and disgusting then I guess we all are in my family.  Oh yeah, \"good for you!\".",
