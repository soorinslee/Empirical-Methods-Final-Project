As stupid as he is, I really don't think he's so dumb to write down a goddamned criminal conspiracy to overthrow the election through a riot. \n\nHowever, the material will make clear that there was no genuine belief that the election was actually stolen. It'll be clear that Trump was attempting, through legal or illegal-but-non-justiciable mechanisms to overthrow the will of the people. It'll be clear that a number of Republicans supported these plans.\n\nIn response to these findings, Liberals will denounce the actions of Trump as clearly villainous. Republicans will not give a shit.",
