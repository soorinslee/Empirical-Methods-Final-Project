Literally nobody even noticed it was 1080p in performance mode until this analysis video and yet the moment it's mentioned the toxic muppets come out of the woodwork claiming this somehow invalidates the game. First off anyone who actually plays the game wouldn't have noticed the resolution differences which means these toxic comments are almost certainly from people who have neither played nor purchased GotG. Secondly the whole presentation and story are better than the movies and hold true to the comics. Thirdly and also lastly the engine used is pretty old making the achievements of Eidos even more amazing. \nClearly Square didn't man up on the budget side of things yet we still got this amazing game. In short grow the f*&k up people. If you're not gamers then go place your toxic comments on videos about something you actually do! Pretty sure gaming isn't one of those things!",
