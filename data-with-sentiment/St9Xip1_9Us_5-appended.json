Just seems like there is plenty of space to put the toilet in the shower area. Then just move the toilet if you need too... \nWith the curtain across the shower the toilet and the other things would be out of sight. give a real bathroom feeling to the area.\nJust a thought but maybe your way works better for you... I do love the van.",
