There's literally no reason to buy a new device if you already bought one in the last 3 years as they all performs nearly identically. What looks like performance upgrades on paper is in real life use so miniscule that nothing has changed in 3 years. Some ACTUAL hardware upgrades is needed, next gen upgrades, PS2 and Gamecube performance. Especially now when these high-end handheld devices like Steam Deck are being released, something needs to fill the huge gap.",
