Would be better with a more liberal leader who also wanted to reduce extremists' power over laws and society. But it does not have much reporting on Iran and where their new leaders stand on many issues and also what his goal is to take over after you left the country in ruins (easier to create extremists that they can turn to the West or try to get them to change religion and become an antithesis to Saudi) or they want to seize the assets there to become a very rich country and start mining and they decide on a large part of minerals so everyone will have to follow their will for trade and hope to become a new superpower in the region. It is still too quiet about what their goals are or it is not reported as we in the EU have energy shortages and logistics problems in addition to the virus and some natural disasters, such reporting has decreased.",
