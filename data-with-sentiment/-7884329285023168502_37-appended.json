While taking Air Force One to Rome, Biden made only one call House Democrats were briefed on \u2014 to Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), to tell her he appreciated her CNN appearance talking positively about their agenda. *Biden then reiterated that he wasn\u2019t explicitly pushing for the House to pass the infrastructure vote immediately, according to multiple Democrats familiar with that conversation.*\n\n...\n\n&gt; *Biden\u2019s hesitancy to demand a vote Thursday was one of several glaring issues that senior Democrats had with the White House\u2019s strategy during the chaotic nine hours before Pelosi and her leadership team yanked the infrastructure bill for the second time in a month.* As Biden attempted to sell his incomplete social spending framework to the public, delivering a speech shortly after visiting with House Democrats, he and his team did not try to clear up whether or not they wanted an infrastructure vote on Thursday.\n\nHoly moly POTUS. What are you doing. [*emphasis mine*]",
