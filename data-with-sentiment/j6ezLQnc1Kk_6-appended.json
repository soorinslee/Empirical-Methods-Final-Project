Lets see, 4,500 inmates paying $200 per week for 52 weeks is just $48 million. Plus services like occupancy loans at a very fair 10%, and then there is the Unger student loan company prospect. This will be a great passive income endowment for his kids. Payback period 5 years. After 20 the university takes over. Then there are the extra side incomes from the Kushner style Rental agreements where if a student drops out half way through year one, they still have to pay the rent to the end of the rental contract, and thank goodness you didn\u2019t sign up for the full 4 years, \u2018what?\u201d, \u201cohhh you did? So you\u2019d be assured of accommodation for the whole course?\u201d . This will be rotten to the core, I would expect looking at the people involved. Greedy capitalists and gullible academics.",
