The last year or so she was talking more and more about old memories, telling stories of her life going in farther and farther back. So I thought its a good idea. She has an outlet for her memories and we have some piece of her later on.\n\nIt totally backfired.  The kind of generic questions \"How was this part of your life, what did you do then and then...\" totally brought out some memories from times she rather not remember and she felt like she has to fill it all in and write down all the bad stuff too. \n\nIt was kind of heartbreaking.",
