The Costco near my daughters home which is 30 miles from my location has it all the time.  There is another Costco about 6 miles away which had the SF coffee so I bought 2 cartons. Had to ask as it wasn\u2019t  stocked with the other coffee.  It was on an outside aisle. It is carried in stores where ii is most popular. You have taught me to read labels.  Love the wild sardines and the Raos Tomato sauce. Staying away from high carb products.",
