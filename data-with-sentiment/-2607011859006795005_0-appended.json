            "body": "My theory on why we still talk so much about \"legacy\" bands is due to the mainstreaming of the internet which, unlike legacy media, produces \"micro-celebrities\" that target much smaller demographics. We're living in an age where one can be simultaneously famous and unknown... ironically, the bubbles got a lot smaller. We talk about legacy bands because those are the bands that still have widest swath of people who know about them due to the way legacy marketing worked.\n\nAlso: there just really isn't anything new to discover within the rock genre - all the extremes have been explored and exploited.\n\nThe early 2000s saw a ton of experimentation in that area (e.g. fusions of metal and jazz, middle eastern music, surf, etc... but even that was basically just the guys from Mr Bungle and FNM, who had been doing that throughout the 90s) but I think there was a complexity to it that didn't allow it to thrive despite seeming fresh AND being in the heights of Limewire madness. At the same time, we were in the middle of the stripped down \"garage band\" *revival* (which was pulling from early 90s influence mixed with the 70s, but in a more gentrified &amp; suburban style - this was the beginning of the \"OMG remember Moby? Yeah, we need our songs in commercials\" era) that overshadowed any of the experimentation going on... can't sell VWs and Apple products with that shit!\n\n\nSoooo, yeah... the most popular rock band in 2021 is likely not even on most people's radar due to rock's over all decline in popularity combined with the compartmentalization of media targeting smaller demographics (for easier marketing, more sales... think about any \"identity\" then think about the products that are sold to help you express that \"identity\"... yeah, music is part of that \"lifestyle\" package).\n\nTo take this one step further: what does \"rock\" represent? Rebellion, individualism, aggression, etc... doesn't really vibe with today's climate of \"Fuck you, do what I tell you\". Notice how all the \"trouble makers\" from back in the day are now literally part of the establishment... all the \"punks\" and corporations are holding hands. The people that continued to say \"Fuck You\" got sidelined (because they aren't useful anymore).\n\nRock music has no use to the establishment these days, it did what it was marketed to do, now they gotta pull back &amp; push music that encourages a culture of conformity. One could argue that hip-hop has taken the spot of rock, in terms of those particular qualities... but hip-hop hasn't been \"dangerous\" to the establishment since the late 80s, when it was co-opted and turned into another lifestyle product (again, with an entire range of products YOU need to buy to fit in to that culture). Not to mention the unbearable levels of conformity in that community (which is highly ironic, but useful, for several reasons).\n\nThink about it this way.... where do you think you'd be more likely to hear rap vs rock being played - at the capital on 1/6 or at CHAZ in Seattle? Then consider that one of these events was swept under the rug despite 5 people getting shot by the people involved and was allowed to be replicated in several other cities (which added at least 3 more deaths... totaling at least 8 shot + 3 dead.. including a child), while the other event happened only once and people are still hand-wringing over it nearly a year later (5 deaths, but only 1 was due to the people involved - cops &amp; heart attacks got the rest).\n\nIt should be rather obvious that one of these groups is not seen as a threat to establishment. Injury and loss of life among the little people is quite obviously not a concern of the establishment... so go ahead, have beef with each other - the more the better... just don't fuck with your \"masters\" in the government ;)\n\nIf everyone took marketing classes we would have a completely different society (though the real insidious stuff doesn't happen in class but in the office, behind closed doors and signed NDAs) \u2014 you're being manipulated far more than you realize.",
