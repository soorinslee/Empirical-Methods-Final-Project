Although, the truth is you are holding on to a single hope that the person who mean the world to you would still wait until you are finally able to fix yourself being a mess but you don\u2019t wanna be a selfish one either to keep the love and stay without giving assurance to anything so you took a heavy choice and that is to walk away carrying the faith deep in your heart that what\u2019s meant to be will always be.\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d",
