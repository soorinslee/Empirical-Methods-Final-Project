Using these numbers, if you only saved $10,000 at the end of your 20s, this is how the math would theoretically work. \n\n\u2022 Decade 1: $10,000\n\n\u2022 Decade 2: 20,000 -&gt; $10,000 increase\n\n\u2022 Decade 3: $40,000 -&gt; $20,000 increase\n\n\u2022 Decade 4: $80,000 -&gt; $40,000 increase \n\n\u2022 Decade 5 $160,000 -&gt; $80,000 increase\n\nSo every decade you delay, you lose significantly more; you lose the opportunity/potential for the doubling of larger numbers. \n\nNow hopefully, you don\u2019t just save the $10k and stop; presumably you\u2019d be adding more to the pot as the decades tick off. But every decade you delay is *significant* to the final math.",
