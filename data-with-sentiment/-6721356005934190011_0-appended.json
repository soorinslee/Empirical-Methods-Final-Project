Also freely lie to Congress while under oath.\n\nNext is U.S. civil trials.  \"There was and is no 'criminal' crime being committed, so there is no need to show up at trial.\" Also freely lie to the court while under oath.  After all, it's not a criminal trial and nothing criminal or major happened.\n\nFinally, U.S. criminal trials against their (usually powerful) allies.  \"We are teh LAW! Also it's all a witchunt anyway.  No need to testify, speak truthfully, or answer subpoenas.\"",
