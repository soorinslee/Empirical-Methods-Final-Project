In the process of knowing God, we have created innumerable religions with all kinds of belief systems and commandments and millions of people have been slaughtered and massacred in the name of religion ! \n\nIn Hindu culture, seeking existential truths is the basis ; here it is full of  debates and discussions ; even the realised Spiritual Masters in this culture could only be a guide post  and it is for the spiritual aspirant to walk alone, throwing away all the crutches and realise existential truths for himself, by himself, unless such a one was already an highly exhalted soul needing just a nudge from his Master to reach his goal or becoming one without a second !",
