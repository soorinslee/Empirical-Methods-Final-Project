One of the major differences is that you don't go past a math problem or some grammar item until they know it 100%.  That way they are never haunted by what they didn't really get before.  You might think that would slow them down, but instead they actually speed up.  And you don't get kids graduating with a poor education.  It would be a major overhaul, but should be considered. \n\nI also had to pull my son out of school in the 4rth grade.  He was being bullied as well and I had to stand up for him.  He also had severe dust allergies and it made him sick.  I worked with him on his schooling and he was an A student despite his absences.  He came home at the end of the year and told me he had to repeat 4rth grade.  I stormed into the principle's office.  She told me it was Virginia state law that if you missed x many days you had to repeat the grade.  I told them that was a stupid blanket rule especially since he had such stellar grades and was on the principle's list.  So I took him out of the system and home schooled him from that point on.  He did fabulously.  He even was the chief Technical officer at his first major employer at age 25.    When I moved to Florida, we also ended up home-schooling my 2nd boy.  We tried the schools in Florida, but they are a disgrace.  Basically he has  been home schooled his entire life.  Went to college and got a masters degree and now works for a major think tank company.",
