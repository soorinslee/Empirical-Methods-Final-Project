The government is NOT your friend and they need to stay out of the curriculum being taught because their curriculum is anti American racist nonsense.  Our kids are our future and they need to learn to read, write, and do math, along with life skills they will need to succeed.  Teaching them to be racists will not accomplish anything but fuel the hatred being taught. Kids don't see color, they see other kids.",

It is also what happened on Jan. 6.  Make the connection and you will know who really won the 2020 election.  Nor, I would bet, were these Dems Virginians.
