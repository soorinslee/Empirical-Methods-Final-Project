Please note that the oil content is more in the seeds of fruit of green cardamom with average green colour than that of fully green cardamom. You can test it with your teeth by breaking the seeds. It is best to offer price based on litre weight of cardamom to get good quality in terms of oil content and flavour. It is the trick of traders to get maximum profit from the business to grading according to colour and size. So go for litre weight to access the quality. Iam a cardamom farmer for the last 15 years.",
