            "body": "I think you might have some issues with the pvc pipe plumbing on the rv. Because when it dumps they work on a gravity system. And it doesn\u2019t flush with normal water pressure to push out waste like regular house plumbing. So normally when people use a hose they angle it on a slope so the waste goes down with gravity. And if you do get a clog you can shake the hose up and down to help free it. So keep an eye on that. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised that the builder designed it like that.",
