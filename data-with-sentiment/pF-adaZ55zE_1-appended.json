But I also had this thought, have you thought about doing a \"this is how to apply makeup\" series? Like going through and explaining: where to put highlighter/bronzer, what some products do, how to do your brows, eye looks, etc. I ask because as a woman that didn't learn makeup from a female figure in her life, I've had to pick up things from YouTube and I still get some stuff wrong (hello contour). And I wonder if there are other men and women out there like me who would love to learn the basics or even some more advanced techniques. I think the way you talk to the audience and the explanations you do in videos are great and I love to hear you talk about how products work. I'd love to learn so much more from you.  <3",
