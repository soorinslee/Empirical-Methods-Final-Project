Being a \u201cdreamer\u201d in America it is so incredibly heartwarming when an American man like Beau is this honest and respectful about the world, and therefore sets the example for our younger Americans, it\u2019s so rare, because his generation is still part of that project to erase the idea of a fair society that wasn\u2019t out there to subjugate the rest of the world, that toxic individualism that contaminated America during the Cold War, that ended up selling out the country slowly to the highest bidder because money always came first. \n\nbecause one of the saddest thing here is how the country has been treating the \u201cwoke American culture\u201d, it\u2019s hard to watch them try to degrade, defraud and destroy the one generation of Americans who TRULY understands what the United States is supposed to mean, and is supposed to become, woke America seems to be the only America that gets \u201cAmerica\u201d, these Americans now are growing up under the corruptive conditions we had to endure in Latin America, so we truly connect to them, I mean all \u201cglitches\u201d aside it\u2019s thanks to the internet that for the first time we have a generation in this entire continent that can see eye to eye, even with a physical wall between us, this is the first step, now all we have to do is keep pushing for more investment in public education, we will eventually stabilize our continent, and we have to do it in time because now only is it \u201cthe new world\u201d but it\u2019s also \u201cthe last world\u201d, we need to get climate change under control, and we can only do it peacefully with an open boarder system, we can\u2019t keep sabotaging Central America.",
