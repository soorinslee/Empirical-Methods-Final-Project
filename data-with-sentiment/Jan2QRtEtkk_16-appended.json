Crime is soaring in every US city. Leftist politicians have changed the laws. It's increasingly futile for the police departments that haven't been de-funded to arrest criminals who commit crimes like these. When they are arrested, they're immediately released, on low or no bail. Plus if the assailant is black and the victim isn't, anyone who wants to intervene, does so knowing they'll be labeled a 'racist', and then doxxed, fired or even arrested. Being a Good Samaritan no longer means being brave in the moment. It means risking your livelihood. This is what happens in the intersection of \"woke\" culture + pro-criminal laws.",
