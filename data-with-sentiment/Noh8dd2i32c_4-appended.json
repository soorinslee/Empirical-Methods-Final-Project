But really light. Or would it be strange to maybe have a rug that is at the foot of the bed but under the legs of a chest that\u2019s there?  We have two black labs and when they aren\u2019t sleeping in the bed they are somewhere near it. Just trying to keep the light colored carpet light, too.   Damn dogs. (I couldn\u2019t live without them \u2764\ufe0f). Thanks for your videos!  Glad I found you! :-)",

I was really hoping you'd mention the position of the bed. We stayed with several family members in America this Summer and every single guest room had the bed directly under the window. So every morning we lay there staring at the ceiling or a blank wall or a single painting. I never realized how unpleasant that was but when we got home it was almost euphoric to lie in bed looking our our big windows at 3 trees of different colors with birds in them.",
