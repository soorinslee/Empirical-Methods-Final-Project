Did the journalist really believe she can reflect the majority in Kuwait?? Or her western lifestyle seems more relatable to their western audience?  News should be focused on the majority, the ordinary people and the disadvantaged. This image of how people suffer the heat in Kuwait is wrongly presented as you must consider how much the majority can afford: what will happen to the people who don't have such an awesome house or a workplace with AC system? or like the other commenter said, those who must work a labour job? How many people in Kuwait can have an influencer job in which you can adjust your own work hours and locations to your need?  PLEASE SHOW THE LIVES OF THE ORDINARY, NOT THE PRIVILEGED.",
