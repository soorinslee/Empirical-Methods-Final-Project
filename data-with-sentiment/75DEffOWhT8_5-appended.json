I cried myself to sleep 4 times today. I feel paranoid that Roblox may never come back. Roblox has the only thing that brings me joy in this cruel life for 7 years now and I won't be able to recover mentally or financially if it's gone. I've spent over $7,000 on Roblox this week alone. I even bought $500 worth of Roblox stocks because I trust Roblox. I told my mom through tears and she yelled at me calling me a \"failure\" and saying she knew she should have been on birth control. Although, Roblox being down has had it's positive impacts on me. My IQ has increased by 40 and I've been thinking more critically. When I saw the \"We're making things more awesome. Be back soon\" page, I vomited. I just hope they mean it when they say soon. I even started praying again. I've been a dedicated Christian for 12 years and I began to pray to god in hopes that they can bring Roblox back soon. I had to learn Arabic to pray to Allah. I hope Roblox comes back soon I don't know how much longer I can take this.p",
