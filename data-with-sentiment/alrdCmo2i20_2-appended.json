So I did that and it actually did a fairly good job of reproducing my major facial features. It wasn't perfect of course, but with my gear on it looked enough like me that it was passable.",

From an April 2006 interview:\nWell to tell you the truth, this happened a couple of years \nago.  At the time our team was working on a game called Mario Artist: \nPolygon Studio for the N64 DD.  As you know it was an extra accessory \nfor the N64. In Polygon Studio you could create 3D models and animate \nthem in the game, but there was also a side game included inside.  In \nthis game you would have to play short games that came one after \nanother.  This is where the idea for Wario Ware came from.",
