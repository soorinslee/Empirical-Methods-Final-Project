They all have their house and family nearby the farm itself and atleast 3 person works for the same farm a day from a family so yeah the job is convenient and nothing special compared to other farming practices except for men where things get difficult due to the inclined position of land and rocks it's hard to carry the bags weighing 50kg a person and to mix the sand for both plantation and cleaning process especially in rainy season. It's the peace and aroma that matters to us and keeps ourselves happy all the time despite other factors like low wages etc. I live in the southern part of India (Kerala - Munnar to be specific).",

The farmers want the government to buy from them, to ensure good prices, but the farmers are not the innocent lot. They will sell bad stuff to government. \nWhen prices go high they will sell to private. The cardamom even when tiny is doused of pesticides in India, get some lab to check it. Its not fit for humans.,But, since in India there is no testing(testing happens of someone dies),no bother. \nThey will say cardamom is the  delicacy of the upper  class. And btw, certified organic will get zero more price in India as middle men dont care. \nThus its a ethics less society. The only ethics is while dealing with family and close friends, there a lot of ethics exist unlike in the west.",
