Several months ago we got a new queen bed frame. This time it's goodbye dust ruffle/bedskirt hiding who-knows-what under the bed, and hello mid-century modern with the bedspread neatly tucked in around the mattress and the wood legs showing - goodbye years of unworn clothes hiding under the bed. I cannot tell you how freeing this was, to get rid of the literal crap under the bed. The few out of season clothing items I kept are easily stored in my closet. The clothes that didn't fit and never were going to fit again were donated to a thrift store, and are no longer taunting me. It's been a breath of fresh air to get rid of all that stuff. The new bed frame has a lower profile, and we don't need a box spring with it, and now the room looks so much bigger. The only down side is our cats had to find new places to hide.",
