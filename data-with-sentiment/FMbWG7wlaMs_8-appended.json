This house is huge but definitely radiates the same energy as you and I love that. You've certainly made it your home! Also that bathroom is literally bigger than my enitire house. \ud83d\ude02 It's so crazy to see how far you've come in your YouTube journey, this is certainly a family home and/or a good home for gatherings like you said. I also just love the flow of the place and how organized and just beautifully picked out each piece is that matches with all the colours and the vibes of the place. Can't wait to see more content from this beautiful place!",
