I'd say new world is perfect for a beginner... you can play basically how you want up to max level, there is alot of freedom in the weapon and armor builds, and the hard things can be effectively avoided untill you are ready for a challenge.. The community seems a little toxic but that's sort of expected since the endgame has a big draw on pvp. The perk to new world vs say ff or wow. You only gotta buy it once, not a subscription model. Untill the loads of xpacs come out at least.\nTLDR: give new world a shot. 40$ for a weekend of mmo goodness is equal to a couple theater visits... so why not?",
