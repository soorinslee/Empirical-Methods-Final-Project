All they can do to keep it up is to have  people fight each other over crumbs. Our government does not represent us and the media has taken sides, either on the right or left. That means neither give you info if it against there party. Both sides are full of it. I had to finally admit to myself even the media and politicians I listen to are full of it. I also finally decided I am not going to hate my neighbor because they listen to lyes by the right or left. Totally independent now, tv off, and back to liking everyone again. This country has always found its strength in the people not just a had full of greedy politicians who lye more then lawyers. Just my two thoughts!",

I would guess that is due to either they were afraid of doing damage to their OWN careers or they agree( which I think is a lot of it ) with socialist polices themselves. I\u2019m not sure that those who consistently stand up for the people could fill up both hands. So all in all they for the most part are DISASTERS!!!!!!!!",
