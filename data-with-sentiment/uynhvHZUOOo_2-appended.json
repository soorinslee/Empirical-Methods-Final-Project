Seeing all of those impoverished people, this could have just as easily been about how capitalism is destroying the world.\n\nThe crazy thing about all of this, is that it's supposedly being caused by a minutia of 0.01% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Not to mention that average temperature has only increased by 1\u00b0 after all these years. How could this possibly be responsible for the inclement weather?\n\nHow can anyone take climate change seriously? It's about as serious as that guys beard. It's just fear mongering. By the rate we're going, it's unlikely we'll even add 0.01% more CO2 in this century.\n\nIt's obvious to me, and it should be obvious to everyone else, that any increase in temperature is just because of urbanization, population growth and tremendous amounts of heat being pumped into the environment.",
