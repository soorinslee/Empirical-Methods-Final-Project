Because the best thing when you arrive at some place and have to unpack, is to have something to hold your suitcase above the floor! So convenient! Otherwise you have to put your suitcase on the bed and it might stain the bedding, or bend over the floor when your back is already strained from travelling. And when unpacking is done, the bench can be used as an extra seat to help put on your shoes or deal with dressing up a kid.",
