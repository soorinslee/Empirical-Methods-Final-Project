Well I wouldn\u2019t have graduated if it wasn\u2019t for that advice because on two separate occasions my GPA was low enough to not graduate unless I got a certain grade on a final. Well, during my college journey, I realized I was falling behind and needed certain grades in order to pass and avoid another expensive year of school which I didn\u2019t want to finance whatsoever. So I went to the office hours and communicated that I needed a certain grade in order to graduate. The professors were so helpful and I felt like they cared enough to help their student.

I want to help my students, but I'm not extra-motivated to do so if they won't help themselves (I am still *normally* motivated, though!). Be real with me and I'll do what's fair and reasonable, and even more, to help you out.\n\nI've given extensions to students who just straight up asked if they could make up Friday because game XXXXX is coming out Thursday. I get it, I would have appreciated that back when 16-bit graphics were cool. These students were honest and real. Just be real. Need a moment/day to collect yourself? Good by me, I've been posting my class sessions privately on YouTube for years, and can send you a link. Miss an assignment by a few hours? It's okay just don't make it a habit. In many classes (NOT all) a late assignment is better than no assignment.\n\nA lot (not all, unfortunately... Maybe they're lizard people? [Joking!]) of your professors are also real people with real lives outside of work. Today at 8:30am I joined a work meeting early and watched a colleague playing \"Here Comes the Sun\" by The Beatles on a guitar he made himself. He was proud of his handiwork, and played really well, but he also wanted us early arrivals to hear something positive to start the meeting. Your professors really are real humans. Yes, even the douchebag ones.\n\nDisclaimer: despite what you might have heard, faculty are generally pretty smart. Be real, not exploitative or fake, and don't lie. You *might* get scorched otherwise.",
