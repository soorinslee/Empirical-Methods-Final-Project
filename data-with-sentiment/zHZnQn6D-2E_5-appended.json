You seem to have a perfect team. It was such a great makeover.too The plants really worked as a divider without chopping up the space. I would say this was a perfect makeover with all the restrictions you had to work with. Seriously impressed.",

And the interesting thing about this make-over is, that I don\u2019t like much og the stuff you brought into the apartment: the wicker lamp takes away from the hanging plants - in wicker baskets. I don\u2019t like any of the art you chose, especially the tapestry is hidious - sorry love\u2639\ufe0f. And waaay to much black. But you know what - it all works together despite my dislike. Good job girl\u2764\ufe0f",

I've found the videos really inspirational and fun. Because of the time difference, I usually enjoy your makeovers over a lovely Sunday breakfast - It's something I really look forward to on the weekend. I hope you hit 400,000 soon and that Xico makes a speedy recovery.",
