It took me a couple listens to really like and appreciate it, but now I love it.  The Dudamel rec with the Simon Bolivar youth orchestra is the best recording I've heard on YouTube so far\n-Price's Ethiopia's Shadow in America, the 2nd movement specifically: absolutely beautiful, so so pretty, Price's slower pieces in general are some of the most beautiful things ever composed\n-Beach's Piano Quintet: so epic and beautiful\n-L. Boulanger's Faust et Helene: so good, it's for orchestra and 2 or 3 singers, the way their voices compliment each other is just unmatched from what I've heard\n-Coleridge-Taylor's arrangement of Deep River: so so pretty\n-Takemitsu's Between Tides: like Sensemay\u00e1 it took me a while to like and appreciate, but now I love it\n-Lavista's Reflejos de la Noche: string quartet, but only uses harmonics.  The effects are so so cool and the piece overall is beautiful\n-Alvarez's Metro Chabacano: rhythmic, quite approachable, very cool",
