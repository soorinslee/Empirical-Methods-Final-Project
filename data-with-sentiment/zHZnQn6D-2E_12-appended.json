Mine is store bought with storage in it - like a bookcase behind our bed. but you could totally DIY it. Think of a tall, skinny box - width of the bed, depth of 5-6\u201d, and tall enough that pillows can lean but you can still reach the top from laying down. The top surface gives you enough room for a little lamp, a couple books, baskets with bedside nicknaks, space for a water bottle, etc. Build it out of project board, sand and paint. It can be freestanding and you could still hang art or do an arch above it.",
