It's a shame we have this strange group of people in this country that doesn't appear to exist anywhere else in the world. It's some odd cultural group that cannot coexist with the world.\n\nWhat are Republicans expectations of this world? I'm really curious. Do they honestly think they're a competitive group of people who can uplift the country to a level that makes us challenge our fiercest economic, military, or technologically developed competitors?\n\nDo you Republicans seriously think you know anything about anything? It's a bizarre thing to observe such dumb people try to act like they're on some main stage when countries like China could flick them away like a booger. If it weren't for common sense people holding this place together we wouldn't have a seat at the table.\n\nRepublicans know that deep down. They're non competitors.",
