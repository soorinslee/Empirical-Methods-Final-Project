The planet is 5.4 billion years old, experienced 5 seperate ice ages in which glaciers extented to almost the equator. Humans didn't exist during those times, what ended each ice age, considering almost nowhere was capable of developing a substantial heat source? The \"experts\" have also stated that even net zero wouldn't change anything, so I'm questioning the motives. Why hasn't a single person reverted back to a stone age lifestyle if they care so much? The earth is 70% water, 30% land mass, that land mass is not fully developed or industrialized. Fossil fuels have been used for 140 years roughly. Taking that data, you expect people to believe humans are impacting the planets climate independent from natural cycles? People will believe anything now days, follow the money. Green technology will become more profitable than fossil fuels and has the cover of being \"beneficial\" for the planet.",
