You\u2019re right that it\u2019s almost a more joyful dissonance type of composer. Love his works! And now, I feel compelled to listen to all of Mahler\u2019s Symphonies so that I can decide which one is my favourite, although I do regularly listen to No. 5 and love it. So many great pieces to discover. Thank you TwoSet for this type of video!",
