Please share more cool vocal and choral music on this channel (and if you want some pointers, get in touch \ud83d\ude03). Parry is considered to have had an impact on Elgar's music, and he also taught Holst and Vaughan Williams! He has a lot of really great vocal and church music.\n\n2) Sibelius' Sapin is part of a collection (op.75) of five short piano pieces. Sibelius did indeed write stuff like this basically to make money, and didn't care too much for the piano. The piece is really nice though, and the other ones in the opus are interesting too!\n\nPlease keep making more videos like this Twoset!",
