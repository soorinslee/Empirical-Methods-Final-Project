Twenty five percent of the world\u2019s population were its subjects.    Fifty years later, it was gone.   Today, the British people will tell you that they are no longer a world power.   Wars, run away spending, weak government and a turn to socialism led to the down turn.   Venezuela was the richest country in the Southern Hemisphere 15 years ago.   Today, it is the poorest under a socialist government.   You are fools if you think it can\u2019t happen to us.    Joe Biden will take this country down if we don\u2019t stand up to this radical left agenda.",
