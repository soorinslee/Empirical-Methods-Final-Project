Most don\u2019t realize those spots don\u2019t simply explain the value of each item but actually are where they need to pay. I suggest either moving the price frames or moving the barrels to a more noticeable place.\n\n(Noticed after watching Keralis try to figure it out in his video)",

Could have been a facetious Keralis gag, but he was complaining about having trouble spotting the barrel. Of course he simply recommended a payment barrel in front of the module, equally elegant. If you have some spare levels you could always rename your octagon brand shulkers for your products all pay in the barrel, but I think you have communicated thoroughly, just have a visibility issue.",
