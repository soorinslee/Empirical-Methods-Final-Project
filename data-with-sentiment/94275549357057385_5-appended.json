Content releases, new characters, and events are more than enough to keep the casual player busy (I have time to play 1-2 hours a few days a week).\n\nI truly love this game and think it's really special. I've tried to convince some of my hardcore gamer friends to play and they all call it a slot machine and a grind.... These are some of the same people that have been playing WOW for like 10 years, didn't mind paying for the games and expansions, monthly fees, etc. It blowsy mind.",
