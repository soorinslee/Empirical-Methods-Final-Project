The idea is, if you were a loyal customer with your previous company for a long time, maybe you'll be loyal to this company too; and also, again, to entice you to switch companies.  \n\nSo here's an example scenario. Let's say your rate with company A is $100 per month and you've been with them for 5 years. Company B offers you $90 per month. So you think, fuck it, it's cheaper so I might as well. 6 months later, your renewal rate is $150 per month. What the hell? That's a huge increase. It is what it is, they say, rates change over time (this is true). Well, you say, I'm going back to company A, they only charged me $100 per month with only small fluctuations each term. You get a quote from company A for $180 per month. Guess what? Now you've only been with your company for a single term, which is usually 6 months. You're not a good customer anymore, so you don't get the best rate.  \n\ntldr: Only switch insurance companies if the savings are significant. You could save money in the short term and screw yourself in the long term.",
