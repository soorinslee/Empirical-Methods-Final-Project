I used to host guests 4-6 months of the year, and did not have a life of my own. My husband is half Italian, so he loves people coming, but he went fishing so they could have fish or crab, and I was left with cooking, cleaning, beds, laundry and so forth. We became the holiday destination. When I asked my family, or friends to book a hotel my husband was mortified. I was tired!! \nIt is ok for a few people now and then, and a few days at a time, that never bothered me. It was the two weeks in a row, and I had girls, garden, they had many dance classes and school. ..... Anyway.... be careful. \nIt took a couple decades and creating a studio apartment when we built our house to slow guests down.. sort of. I finally ran a bed and breakfast I was already doing it for free for years. \n\nAnyway, be careful how nice and cozy you make it, try to have some things that will be not so comfortable so they know when to go home!",
