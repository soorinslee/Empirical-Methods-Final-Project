They told me I was gullible...and I believed them.\n5. A day without sunshine is like, night.\n6. The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. \n7. Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else get your way.\n8. If ignorance is bliss, then tourists are in a constant state of euphoria.\n9. I didn't use to finish sentences, but now I\n10. I've had amnesia as long as I can remember.\n\nPerhaps one of the most thought-provoking one-liners is \"Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway.\" It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, \"Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.\" Ever looked with lust? If you have said \"Yes\" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: \"God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com",
