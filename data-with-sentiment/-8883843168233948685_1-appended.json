It means the parents have them covered, so they work to do what they want with the money.\n\n\"Having to\" means if they don't work, someone's going to starve in the family.\n\nThis doesn't go into that topic much, but what I'd be more concerned with employers paying kids \"under the table\". That is, paying kids in cash; meaning they're not in the business' books, skirting child labor laws. Kids that \"have to\" are the ones exploited in this case.\n\nStill, I don't mind when people say stuff like this about US capitalism. If US capitalism could achieve Universal Healthcare, Universal Basic Income, Affordable Housing, and some other things I'm forgetting now, there wouldn't be a lot of criticism from me.\n\nBut, looking at the trajectory of where that style of capitalism is going, especially when schei\u00dfe politicians like Manchin can dwindle climate change policy to less than a trillion, it's not going to work for much longer.\n\nRepublicans' homes are going to be overrun by the ocean, only to blame themselves and who they voted for. Then again, they'll probably collect some flood insurance money, so I guess there's that to look forward to for them (if their insurance company can cover them all).",
