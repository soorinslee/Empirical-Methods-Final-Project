Matthew 24: 6-8 JESUS.\n-\n26 \u201cJust as it happened in the time of Noah, so it will be when the Son of man comes. 27 They ate, they drank, and they married and gave in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark; then the flood came and destroyed them all.\n28 \u201cThe same thing happened in Lot's time: they ate and drank, bought and sold, sowed and built. 29 But on the day that Lot left '' \"'(Sodom)\"' '' fire and brimstone rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.\n30 \u201cSo it will be on the day the Son of man is revealed. Luke 17: 26-30 JESUS\n-\n9 And when you hear of wars and seditions (protests against their rulers), do not be alarmed; because it is necessary that these things happen first; but the end will not be immediately. 10 Then he said to them: Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; 11 and there will be great earthquakes, and in different places famines and pestilences; and there will be terror and great signs from heaven.\nLuke 21: 7-11\n-\n12 and because wickedness has multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.\n13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations; And then the end will come. Matthew 24: 12-14\n-\n22 And if those days were not shortened, no one would be saved; but because of the elect, those days will be shortened. Matthew 24:22 JESUS\n-\n8 But God shows his love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ JESUS \u200b\u200bdied for us.\n9 For much more, being already justified in his blood, by him we will be saved from wrath.\n10 For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life. Romans 5: 8-10\n---\n16 \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only Son (JESUS), so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but may have eternal life. John 3:16\n-\n18 Come quickly, says the Lord, and let us be aware: if your sins are like scarlet, they will be white as snow; if they are red like crimson, they will be like white wool. Isaiah 1:18\n-\n9 that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\n10 For with the heart it is believed for righteousness, but with the mouth it is confessed for salvation.\n Romans 10: 9-10\n--23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 6:23\n-\n12 And in no one else is there salvation; for there is no other name under heaven, given to men, by which we can be saved. Acts 4: 11-12\n-\n10 so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;\n11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Philippians 2: 10-11\n-\n12 But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God; John 1:12\n-\n6 Jesus said to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me. John 14: 6\n-\n23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; because the Father also seeks such worshipers to be adored.\n24 God is Spirit; and those who adore him, in spirit and in truth it is necessary that they adore.\nJohn 4: 23-24\n27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you; I don't give it to you like the world gives it. Not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 14:27\nJESUS.\nThere is power in THE NAME OF JESUS..",
