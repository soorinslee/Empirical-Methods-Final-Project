It was written as memorial to Shostakovich's death, as they were very good friends. The symphony as a whole has the footprint of Shostakovich, but he also uses his own style, harsher brass, more dissonance, and it's really a joy to listen to. In particular, the first and third movements are masterpieces. If anyone reads this, I encourage you to try it out, especially if you love Shostakovich.",
