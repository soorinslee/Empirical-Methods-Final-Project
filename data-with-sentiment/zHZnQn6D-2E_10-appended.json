Definitely swap out the dining chair for a good adjustable height office chair as well, otherwise her bad back will get much worse. In the UK a dining chair would not meet the health and safety at work standards for working from home. As she is tall she may also need to adjust the height of her desk and monitor for optimum comfort. The room does look good, just not totally adjusted for the height of the user.",
