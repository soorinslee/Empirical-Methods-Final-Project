What lessons and life skills is society providing when we focus on idiotic practices of relieving people for the consequences and life impacts of their decisions? What is next? Free houses for everyone and cancellation of mortgages because people should not have to fulfill their debts for the house decision they have made? Where does this idiocy end OR where does it lead? Government housing for everyone, free education for everyone, a nation of college graduates who choose paths that add no value, earning potential or they just decide that they don\u2019t like the educational path and just stay in college because it\u2019s free and there is not consequence.

Getting sick can happen to anybody; and the reason for sickness is quite often hereditary. You might argue that individuals with student loans should have thought about the debt they incurred when they got the loans (just like anybody else who borrows they should understand loans must be repaid). Also, it doesn't seem fair to students who worked several jobs to pay for their education or for parents who saved and made enormous sacrifices to pay for their children's education so the children would not have to be burdened by student loans.",
