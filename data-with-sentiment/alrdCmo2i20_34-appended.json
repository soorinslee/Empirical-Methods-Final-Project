Since the N64 mouse and controller joystick values are different, You cannot hotswap the mouse and the controller (for photos) while playing the game. This is very annoying, but just how the hardware works.",

But dude, if you can take the pics with Sim City, you don't need any Gameboy (let alone three different ones), you don't need Pokemon Stadium and you don't need Mario Artist. If you already had Sim City, meaning you had the 64DD, all you needed was a Transfer Pak and a Gameboy Camera. If you missed one or both, you probably knew some kid who had what you needed, right? I mean kids in 1999 knew how to get hands on a Transfer Pak. So basically, to access this feature on this 64DD game you needed the 64DD and someone you could borrow the Camera from for an afternoon. That should've been managable! And you could literally be in a game in 1999!",
