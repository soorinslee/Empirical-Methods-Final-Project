The only thing made clearer to me than global warming is there is absolutely no way we are going to change in any meaningful way. We've been talking about this for decades and have kept adding to the problem. Yes we're burning less but that has been driven almost 100% by the cost. It just isn't in human nature. We creature things, we consume, we rationalize.\n\nI'm 65 and see no big reason to do anything because I'm probably going to be OK. For me I'm moving to a new location to escape drought and I'm looking at warming effects when choosing a new location. I think talking about warming is now a waste of time that could be used to prepare for the coming results.",

Once we reach certain thresholds these can trigger even more changes which can become like an avalanche. I don't think humanity itself will be wiped out or made 'extinct' but what will become increasingly common is the breakdown of civilisation and more and more collapsed societies. I'm sure humanity will cling on for many more generations, but in what shape will we be? As our world deteriorates in every way, we will slowly lose any sense of hope and optimism for the future. What will children dream of in 2100? I still find it incomprehensible that many politicians and of course fossil fuel execs believe that this hellish vision for possibly the only intelligent life in the universe, is worth trading off for a few more years of profits before they are finally forced to admit that they are sitting on stranded assets. So basically our entire ecological system and millenia of human civilisation are worth a few more Louis Vuitton handbags and luxury cars. That's what we've come to folks.",
