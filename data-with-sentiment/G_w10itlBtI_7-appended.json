I work as a proffesional kitchen planner/sales rep for a one of the largest (and oldest) kitchen manufacturers in Norway. Love the black look you are going for as its very clean and scandinavian looking, however it won\u2019t stay very clean for very long with push-open I\u2019m afraid. Black is one if the hardest colours to keep smudge free on a kitchen and with push-open you\u2019ll constantly get fingerprints everywhere. I would therefor do the backmounted lip handles in black but i would also add push-open to the cabinet with garbage disposal. Always handy to be able to open that with u\u2019r knees or something if u got u\u2019r hands full :) Hope this was helpfull and can\u2019t wait to see how this turns out! Gonna look great \ud83d\ude01",

You can really only use them in wet environments like Kitchens and Bathrooms, when they've been coated with a waterproof material, like finished maple or Melamine (or the shoddy plastic that Ikea uses). Common for all is though that they really, REALLY do not like water. Longer exposure to moisture and water will result in the boards starting to bulge, as the glue gets dissolved and the wood dust starts falling apart in clumps. Add to the equation that the glue used is typically hella toxic and you've got several types of wooden boards that claim to be reasonably durable and environmentally friendly, despite that not being the case. Plywood is more reasonable and way more durable, but I'd far prefer solid wood, regardless of whether it's fir, oak, maple, walnut, Zebrano, teak or whatever other type",
