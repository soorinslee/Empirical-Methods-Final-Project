It did take some getting used to, mostly because the vertical cartridge orientation of the N64 caused us to hold the console with the rear side up.\nGood times.",

I knew somebody who had that and as the result of having it he had more playable characters on The game boy color version of Mario tennis, but what I really wanted it for was to unlock some cheat codes on perfect dark. Just like in Goldeneye all the cheat codes in perfect Dark require beating certain levels on certain difficulties in a short amount of time, but some of these cheats you can actually unlock if you put that combo pack on your N64 controller or whatever and combo the game boy color version of perfect Dark so you can get that cheat unlocked on the N64 version.",
