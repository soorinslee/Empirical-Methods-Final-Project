I anticipated getting it by the time November came for a trip. Never got it. The tracking showed that it was being shipped but never delivered, still in transit from a country I won't name. I ended up buying another jacket and totally forgot about what I ordered. To my surprise it came in January right after my travels. I was pleasantly surprised as it was.exactly as.specified and really well made.  Was going to leave a somewhat half-and-half review on their website but it had closed down.\nI was lucky and am actually allright with what I got but I would _never_ order from one of those FlyByNight sellers again.",
