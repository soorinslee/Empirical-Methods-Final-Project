My husband is comfortable with work from home, so v shifted to our native place last year. 2 months ago the company asked to return to work from office. My husband has asked to relieve him immediately saying he is not willing to return back. The company has asked him to continue till november last. My husband made this decision to quit bcoz inspite of him working so hard always a non-performer is rewarded based on the biased opinion of the manager. He silently tolerated this for 5 years and now he hates to return back to c the biased attitude  of the manager. He is eagerly waiting for the day his company will relieve him. For the first time its the other way around, his manager is requesting him to continue. Unimaginable.",
