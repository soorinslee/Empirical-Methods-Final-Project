Overall as ever I enjoyed the video, but as a pale/cool toned person I would never wear those warm tones and would have liked seeing that other palette chosen - just as something a bit different.  Autumn/Fall tones for me don't include anything orange based and instead I use green/khaki, mauve, plum and burgundy shades.  The cooler toned palette had more of a Winter or party vibe and something a little less seen in affordable brands.  Best wishes.",
