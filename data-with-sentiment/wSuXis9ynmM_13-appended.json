Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love\nwere already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented:\nand quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant\nways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our\nancestors\u2014anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly\nridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the\nscientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death\nto a world which already bristled with such chances and in which\ndeath itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.\n\nThis is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to\npull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an\natomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and\nhuman things\u2014praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to\nmusic, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends\nover a pint and a game of darts\u2014not huddled together like\nfrightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies\na microbe can do that, but they need not dominate our minds.\u201d\n\n - CS Lewis",
