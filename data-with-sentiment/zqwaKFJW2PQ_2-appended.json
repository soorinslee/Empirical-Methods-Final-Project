There is nothing wrong with being a Democrat or a Republican and we do need each other no matter how much we differ on what is best for the country.  But you win some and you lose some.  That is how it\u2019s supposed to be. That is what Democracy is...Trump is fighting to be dictatorial... Lying about the election to stay in power is one way a dictator regime gets started.  Keeping false conspiracies alive because those leader\u2019s support you is dead wrong. Calling people SOB\u2019s for trying to fight for injustice is dead wrong. Some people are ok with it because his ideology aligns with theirs. Making one side (Democrats) the enemy is dead wrong.  Trump represents all of that... He\u2019s just not good to be President of the US...",
