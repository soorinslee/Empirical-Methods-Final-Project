I converted the room into a Guest Room (for him too of course).  According to your tips, I did very well!  The big edit, deep cleaning, the pristine linens, two options for pillows, extra blanket, cupboard space, happy pegs/hooks, freshly cleaned housecoat, night table and easy lighting, nice towels, and a little basket ... BUT here are two things that I want 'rock star' points for!  1) I upholstered a bench that can be easily moved around and improvised as a bench, coffee table or laptop desk or for snacking (and a tray for that) and 2) An empty storage basket/box with a lid that the Guests can use to contain their valuables.  And VOILA, my teenager just arrived for the weekend a few hours ago ... for a 'test run'!  Thank you, Lisa!  Your timing for this Guest Room Vid just adds to the glory!",

I'm constantly staying in hotels obviously designed by a man and NOT Lisa...the mirror in the room (where I style my hair while the shower is being used and adding humidity to the bathroom mirror area) is NEVER near the outlet I need for my styling tools.",
