It's getting to expensive for the oil companies to extract what remains of our fossil fuel reserves, unfortunately Green/Renewable energy is neither green nor renewable. Wind turbines and solar energy panels are made from materials which must be extracted from the earth. These materials are just as finite as fossil fuels and to extract these materials will cause a great deal of damage to the environment - as I said NOT green and NOT renewable. At this point in time civilization has nothing to transition to from fossil fuels that is truly renewable and green.",

Also, the longer the frost free period the more different types of fruits, vegetables, and even grains can grow and so the areas in the Northern Continents, e.g. the Great Plains of North America and Canadian and the great expanses of Russian tundra will become world cropping centers with citrus growing as far north as the Canadian border.   Deciduous trees will replace pines, scrub oak will replace oak and the area of grassland prairie will expand.
