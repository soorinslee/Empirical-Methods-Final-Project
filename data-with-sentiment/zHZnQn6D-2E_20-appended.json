That dining room chair is not a goo choice for someone who works from home, it will become increasingly uncomfortable. I think that you could have found a desk chair that was both comfortable to work from, and aesthetically pleasing. Why do you always put down rugs, large or small, that slip and slide on the floor? That seems to be hazardous. It would be best to put the non-slip pads under them to prevent an accident. I think this is my favorite video you've done to get the best use of space in a small (tiny) environment. Great job!",
