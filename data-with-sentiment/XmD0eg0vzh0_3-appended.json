The other thing is you prepared the children well ahead to embrace and look forward to the new environment and at the same time to say goodbye to the old. This, how to respond to change, is something they will treasure  through out their life. Ms. Reese though in this video. I wish you a blessed and enjoyable new chapter in the family",

If possible store  your beautiful piano in a temperature controlled space to keep it in good condition, ie no huge humidity/temp fluctuation it could severely damage your piano otherwise. I had to store an upright once in prep for moving to my piano studio and had blankets all wrapped around our piano and it worked quite well to protect it on the move and keep it warm in a space that wasn\u2019t heated. Just a Piano loving tip from a piano teacher that enjoys your videos. :)",
