I'll build difficult dark shades but I lost all patience with flaky light ones. Since a lot of holiday looks really rely on those shimmers would you please point out which ones you think are creamy age friendly ones? I think this CG palette fit pretty well! \u2661Love you! Prayers for your mom and all of you. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9d\u262e\ud83d\udd49",

I feel like people often forget you can MIX blush and other face products. If a blush is too deep I just dip back and forth between my blush and my face powder and it lightens it!",
