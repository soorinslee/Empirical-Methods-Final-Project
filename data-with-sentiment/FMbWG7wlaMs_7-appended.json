Where in California is it located? How far is it from the nearest city (driving time required )?   If you work from home, it's perfect ! \nWould you mind answering these questions? \n1)  Do you have solar panels on the roof?  What are the energy saving features?\n2)  Height of the ceiling?  Is the height the same for each floor?\n3)  Area of the first floor including the garage ?\n4)  Length & width of your building?\n5)  Costs of the following ( approximate values are fine ) :\n       - House construction    \n       - Architect's fees\n       - Interior Designer's fees \n       - Furnishings & installation labour   \n\nThanks a million !!!\n( Note:  I'm in the process of planning my own dream home.  I would appreciate any real life guidelines as reference on completed new homes, especially on the costs. )",
