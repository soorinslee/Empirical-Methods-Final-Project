This is just, like, my opinion maaaann.\n\nA few of my picks have already been stated (Zep and Rush are a given, everyone knows Dave Grohl goes hard on drums love me some TCV, and Travis Barker is a huge part of why I like Blink) so I'll mention a few I'm not sure others will mention:\n\nBen Thatcher of Royal Blood. Literally any song by them features him in a big way; he's half the band, after all.\n\nMatt Donnelly of Don Broco. Hard to think of a specific song but I feel he's in the spotlight a lot on their new album.\n\nAnd I feel like a lot of people sleep on Josh Dunn of T\u00d8P. Another drummer who's half the band and really brings it. Guy grooves.",
