It has allowed tiny marginal groups to build up power and spread very dangerous ideas. Everything from COVID denial to the spreading of white supremacy to flat earthers and anti-evolution and climate change denial, etc, etc. Some of those seem almost harmless (flat earth) but they represent an anti-science, anti-facts, anti-truth culture that has become very powerful here and around the world. It\u2019s extremely dangerous and makes it hard to have discussions over policy (which is what I purport we should be arguing about) and instead arguing over basic, provable, facts. I think our country, and the world, is in severe danger because of this.\n\nI don\u2019t have a solution. Free speech is an absolutely critical right. The most important right. But the world has changed. What do we do to protect free speech, but ameliorate the damage caused by social media\u2019s outsized soapbox that it gives to every crazy theory out there. It takes advantage of the flaws in our psychology to make us angry and react without consideration.\n\n*sigh*",
