Both have ensuites.  The guest room on the ground floor is adjacent to a reception room that includes a servery that offers a fridge, freezer (as drawers), microwave, dishwasher, and dishware and cutlery.  When guests are expected to stay there, I bring out the kettle, coffee maker and toaster.  I provide tea, coffee pods, bread, butter, jam, cheese, granola, some fresh fruit, orange juice, milk and cream, and, maybe, some fresh hard-boiled eggs.  That way, my guests don\u2019t have to wait for me to feed them, and they can enjoy their breakfast in solitude in the reception room (with fireplace), or just outside the door on our covered patio, overlooking the back yard and pool.  There is even a stacked washer/dryer in a cabana bathroom on that floor for their use, if desired.  This alleviates the risk of  \u201ctoo much togetherness\u201d that often accompanies house guests.",
