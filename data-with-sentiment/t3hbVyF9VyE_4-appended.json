So why act dumb? Your rich masters are only half-hearted against the CCP. And whole-hearted for the 10% rich, pro-Corporate, Republican. And for these low-power, out of power fools! Trump! Pompeo, Cruz and Paul. You know these are low power, low quality fools! Trump only wanted bribes from China, He was angry because they didn't give enough. Trump signaled he would betray Taiwan and Chinese for his worship of Xi and CCP. Nixon and Republicans betrayed Taiwan for CCP money and business! Taiwan's Pro Republican, Pro Business Party wants closer CCP ties for money! Taiwan Democrat side is the only that pushes away from CCP China! Republicans love the CCP authoritarianism and want to imitate it in America. From Republican, Nixon to now to the future: Republicans are for business and money in China, IGNORING Chinese human or civil rights! Dems are imperfect, in Taiwan and America, but only Dems care about Chinese people and human rights! You are either idiots not to know this, CIA financed, Corporate financed or just dumb to be right-wing. If whole-hearted you would know these obvious points and implement them. You work AGAINST democratic Chinese gain! Censor this, as China censors! But it will remain true - and you know it.",
