But my 7-year-old hates it, too, and I always manage to escape unscathed.  At least I can see her claws; the baby just turned four months and her claws are so tiny, but snag on everything!  She will be trimmed regularly, like it or not.  Back in the day, my purebred Siamese/Tonkinese were declawed.  Vets don\u2019t do that anymore, and my leather furniture is now being scratched up.  Too early to think about replacements, or new drapes.",
