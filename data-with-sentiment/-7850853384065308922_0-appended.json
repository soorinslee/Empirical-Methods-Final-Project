I agree it was gross fascism that perpetuated separating families at the border. But guess what dipshits, any immigrant attempting to enter a country ILLEGALLY takes a fucking risk. Is that priority over excessive federal (not private) loans and interest accruing debt millions of Americans are dealing with? Fuck no. \n\nAnd to the dude that wants to hold the government liable (with tax payers money), youre right. I should have known i would have had to pay my loans back with high interest. But fuck me for being 17 years old and not knowing shit about loans and repayment. Thank you to all those guidance counselors and bursar shit heads.",
