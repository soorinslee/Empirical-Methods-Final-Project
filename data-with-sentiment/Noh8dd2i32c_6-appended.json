Please?",

They usually have a little bench, some shelves, hooks for coats, scarves, maybe a bar to put hangers on. Get one for the bedroom. \n\nIt may seem unorthodox, but I find it super practical. While Nick is absolutely right to point out under-the-bed storage, that works really well for seasonal stuff, like he said, but there\u2019s every-day storage that can make a room messy: I need a place to put a couple decorative pillows I don\u2019t use for sleeping (I don\u2019t just want to throw them on the floor), or what about clothing items you pull out of the closet and wear them for a bit; they are not ready to go into the laundry bin just yet, but you don\u2019t want to put them back in the closet with the fresh cloths. What about your nightwear or loungewear? Where does that stuff go during the day? For me, a hall tree is a great solution to keep all these things organized in one place and prevent my bedroom AND closet from becoming a mess. It even goes well in your bathroom if you have an on-suite. The hall tree is a great transitional space for keeping your transitional items (items not quite in need of storage but not in immediate use) organized and neat. And they come in such varieties of design styles that you can probably find one that looks like \u201cit belongs\u201d in your bedroom/on-suite. I highly recommend it.",
