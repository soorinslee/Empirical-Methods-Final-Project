I usually never ever even glance at ads but the sweatshirt was a white color With \"pumpkin season\" and a pic of a cute pumkpin and I though it would be a cute gift. I bought it for like 16 dollars and had it shipped to me, except right after i got the confirmation email from \"spookyseason\" I went to the link to check the status and the whole site was shut down... Waited a week and then emailed the address attached to the confirmation email asking what's up. Never heard anything so i disputed the charge with my bank and they immediately gave it back to me. To this day I can't find any mention of this \"spookyseason\" brand or site or whatever even though i scoured lots of places. Can't tell if it was a fake site to scam me out of 16 dollars or if they legitimately shut down right after i ordered the shirt. Needless to say i will never buy anything from reddit ads ever again.",

They, however, are not telling you you are signing up for a mass drop, so it comes as a surprise that a couple months can go by before you get your stuff.\n\nI followed up with the company by email and they were responsive for the first few weeks, although they never said anything useful, just false promises that my stuff was on the way.
