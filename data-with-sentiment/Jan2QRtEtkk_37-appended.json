Masculinity is not inherently toxic just like femininity, however like anything there can be extremes of everything. For example, we have seen instances of toxic feminism but you don't see that being talked about. This is just one of those scenarios where a few bad cops labels all of them, but instead, a few bad toxic men creates a \"toxic masculinity\" issue that really isn't even there.",

The worst kind of men are the caveman (uggh!) types,, and even football is  in many ways, a very false notion,,   that knocking another boy, or man down actually means something in real-life!?!?!  That's fugged up!!!   I was always a very strong young man, and was on the wrestling team, gymnastics team, and track & field team!  But, I NEVER abused anyone of my classmates in the SLIGHTEST WAY!!!   I was fortunate to have had 10 years of bible study that made me sensitive to the feelings of others, and Christs teachings firmly affected my view(s) on life!!!!",
