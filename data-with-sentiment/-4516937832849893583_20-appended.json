How do you wonder why people have lost faith in the Supreme Court when the three most recent justices were not only appointed by a president who lost the popular vote; but one sits in a seat that was stolen from the previous president; another is a credibly alleged sexual assaulter who somehow had his massive gambling debts erased by some unknown benefactor shortly before his nomination, taking the seat of another justice who was likely forced out for his son\u2019s Deutsche Bank connections; and the latest is a Federalist Society hack who was shoved down onto the bench two weeks before an election, utterly contradicting the bullshit standard that was created for Gorsuch. All of them pushed onto the bench on party line votes.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be lorded over for decades now by a Supreme Court that wasn\u2019t just packed with zealots, it was bought by dark money to be a dollar menu for foregone rulings on everything you can imagine.",
