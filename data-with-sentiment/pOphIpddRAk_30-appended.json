That trend cannot abate for long or the system collapses. Most of the real needs of society are produced by a small subset of jobs. And it's a subset that's getting smaller and smaller.",

But the thing is lack of communication regarding employee well-being only production oriented work culture created. Immediate positive and constructive action should be taken at Accenture to keep their resources with them. With all my respect and also request \ud83d\ude4f.  Bcz I got depressed and faced mental challenges finally I'm getting out from that trauma. And also I really thankful to Accenture for giving this space to engage with them.",
