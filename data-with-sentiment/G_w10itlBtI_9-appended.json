Keep doors/drawers simple as well. \nCabinets with integrated handles will have an inwardly beveled edge for your fingers to stick into, allowing you to pull the drawer/door open toward you.

The beveled section is recessed... from the outside edge, then diagonalish towards the inside edge. \nHard to explain, but I hope you get the idea, i have them carved into my built-in cabinets and love them.",
