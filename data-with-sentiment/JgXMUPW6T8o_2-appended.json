Attending these events really is a great way to get more out of the hobby and have fun playing too many games in one day. Cool to hear you \"did it right\" and went to your tournament tired and underprepared. Always more fun like that.",

Highlight was vs Wood Elves (who'd just got that big metal forest dragon model) and obliterating it due to afore mentioned broken Chaos Lord.",

I can't stand and play a game for 8 hours like it's my job;  My experience is that most of the people who play competitively aren't actually playing a game b/c they're primarily filling a personal need (to demonstrate to themselves some perceived superiority over others) rather than playing a game.",
