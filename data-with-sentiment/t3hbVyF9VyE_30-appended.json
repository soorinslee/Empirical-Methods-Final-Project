Is there a source somewhere? Some proof more then connecting some loose dots? Any links you could post to back this up? Because for me, even as a china sceptic, this is hard to swallow.\n\nIF this is true It's verry strange noone else is talking about it as it could be one of the worst attrosities ever commited in human history.\n\nIf this is false.. Well It's not sometthing you should go arround and imply that anyone is a part off.",
