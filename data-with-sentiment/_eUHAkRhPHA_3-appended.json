Your tips were spot on, but all I could think about is  the advice my father gave me when I bought my first home...\"Don't ever make your guestroom too comfortable. You will regret it as your guests will never want to leave\"  Boy was he right!  Oh well, lesson learned the hard way.  lol.",

It's true, there's nothing worse than sleeping in a dingy stale unkempt guest bed. There've been times I've slept on top of the bedspread, my coat used as a blanket, no joke.\n\n(I keep clean guest blankets in their original plastic packaging bags with half a dryer sheet tucked inside so they always smell freshly laundered. However, if your guest(s) has fragrance allergies this might be a bad idea. Probably best to ask them before they arrive.)",
