And in the past, guidelines were given for the future - a good and peaceful future. One of the repositories of these motives is the Indian epic Srimad Bhagavatam.\r\n  Through the idea of \u200b\u200b\"animating\" this work, a certain understanding of the task of the ancients can be achieved. This picture, calling for Purity, Goodness, devoted and selfless Love. High quality animation that cleans, refreshes, brings fullness to life. Gives knowledge and support in Kali, is a motivation for studying the origins. If it is made of high quality, then questions will arise, and what is important is the world demand.\r\n The Almighty was and always stood behind these concepts. \"Be holy, for holy I am the Lord your God,\" He says from the Bible. He holds this position in the Koran, this position is reflected in the sacred texts of India.",
