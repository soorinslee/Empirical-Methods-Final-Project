Nadine is such a very talented Actress in her generation. Talented with a Pure and Good Heart. Sobrang strong mo girl and napakagaling mo mag handle ng Emotions. Kasi para sa perception ko ang galing mo and ang strong ng mind mo mg control ng emotions mo from the past, parang feeling ko you struggle alot sa past relationship mo,  pero you respect james and your relationship to him, you never say anything bad about sa pagsasama nyo. Unlike sa ibang celebrity kunting drama nghahanap ng sympathy without knowing nagsisisraan na pala sila, never ka nag salita ng ikakasama ng partner mo, kahit ikaw lagi nababash,nilalait, ikaw lagi sinisiraan... I'm really proud of you.. you're indeed an inspiration as a strong woman \ud83d\udc60\u2640\ufe0f a  Queen\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc78 with a Good Heart \u2764\ufe0f",
