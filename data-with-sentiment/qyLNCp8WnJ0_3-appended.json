He said he can't find them in Florida and if I weren't afraid they'd melt I'd send him some.  It's weird to see people without masks shopping, we are still required here.  It doesn't bother me anymore to wear them, I'm used to it.",

Florida had approx 13,000 Covid cases in the last week and about 870 deaths. My 90 yr old father recently moved there and I am worried about him living there. I'm afraid to go visit.  So, how can you feel safe not wearing a mask?",
