A Kpop group can go 5 years with only 4 songs, of which only two have MVs, and those two are the only promotion they are going to have for another few years. So the PUMP the money into the production. Kpop artists are just employees. The American music industry treats their artists like vendors, contractors, or investments. MVs are necessarily an afterthought because it doesn't make business sense to have 75 sets and 100 designer outfits when the return on investment is so low. Their promotion dollars go elsewhere, and it works...KPop is a juggernaut, but it's not like American artists are diminished.",
