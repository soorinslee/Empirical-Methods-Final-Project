Medic, the medic can only use 1 gun an the rest is heals, also they have to get every reboot and rev they can.\r\n\r\nRole 2. Solider, the solider cannot build and has to only use meat, bandages, combat weapons and minis.\r\n\r\nRole 3. Demolist, the Demolist is simple, all heals and only explosive weapons eg. RPG and grenades.\r\n\r\nRole 4. Fighter, the fighter can use any guns and any heals but they have to participate in every fight and cannot run away.\r\n\r\nHope you like the idea\r\n-PotatoBrains",
