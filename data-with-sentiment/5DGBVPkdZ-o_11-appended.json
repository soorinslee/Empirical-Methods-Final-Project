            "comment": "This is different from her previous songs. The lyrics and music video are works of art, especially in terms of the closure that Jadine fans are finding and the art of moving on. It's a bummer their loveteam ended. There were so many things they could have done to save it, but they chose to go their separate ways and grow more.\n That's why I adore both Nadine and James. James is fulfilling his career by sharing music from his Careless Label, whereas Nadine is finally taking control of her career. She is literally the boss of her own life, and she is taking a chance by living on Siargao.\nTo those who constantly criticize them, understand that what they did was a huge risk in terms of their career, and that they chose what they really wanted to do in life, and I'm proud to say they succeeded.\nCongratulations to Nadine Lustre and the Careless team on this magnificent and wonderful ballad song.",
