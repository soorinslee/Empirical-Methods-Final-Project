Islamic nations, Africa and Central America are top population hot spots.  Everyone's survival, demands a  change in attitude towards family planning,  This requires a universal min marriage age, 21 in China, a universal maximum family size, compulsory birth control and equal rights to women.   The latter is singularly absent in Islamic society but necessary to reduce the birth rate.",

Going about at night, instead of during the day, would be a good idea too. Nocturnal like as our ancestors used to be. When we measure the temperature it is required to put the thermometer in the shade of a \"Weather Box\" : What is a weather box ? You will need some sort of a box to protect some of your instruments and to keep the direct sun, rain and wind off them. The weather box should be placed so that the bulbs of the thermometers (or sensors) are 1.25 meters above the ground. ... What are the characteristics of Stevenson screen ? The Stevenson screen holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dew cell, a barometer and a thermograph. Its purpose is to provide a standardised environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dewpoint and atmospheric pressure.",

Emiratis & Qataris are barely 10% & Kuwaitis 30% of their country's populations ,so they'll find ways to cope or else they'll migrate permanently away from the Gulf. Everyone else in those countries are foreigners anyway so they'll just move on or move home. The problems get much worse the further north you go, into the Iraqi river basin, where millions more locally-born people live, and it's burning up at a similar rate to Kuwait, temperatures in Baghdad are even more terrifying in Summer now than they normally were.\nHumans don't settle in Death Valley and they don't settle in the Danakil in northern Ethiopia, cos they're too damn hot to support life.
