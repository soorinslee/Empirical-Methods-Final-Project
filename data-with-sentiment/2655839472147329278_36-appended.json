            "body": "Since April 8th, The Biden administration has been sitting on a completed Department of Education memo outlining his legal authority to cancel student loan while claiming that they're still working on it lol:\n\n&gt; The Debt Collective activists developed a theory: that the lawyers at the Department of Education had already written their memo, that they had advised Biden that he did have the authority to cancel debt, and that the Administration was keeping the memo quiet because they didn\u2019t like its conclusions. But this was mere speculation. So Gokey, one of the organizers, submitted a request through the Freedom of Information Act. If a memo had already been drafted, then he asked the Department of Education to send it to him. On August 20th, he got the results: dozens of pages of e-mails among Department of Education officials, including a seven-page memo called \u201cThe Secretary\u2019s Legal Authority for Broad-Based Debt Cancellation.\u201d The memo\u2019s contents were redacted\u2014in hot pink, for some reason\u2014but it was proof that a memo existed. \u201cI really felt this version was excellent,\u201d the general counsel at the Department of Education wrote, on April 5th. Three days later, the word \u201cdraft\u201d was removed from the memo\u2019s header. This all seemed to vindicate the activists\u2019 theory.\n\n&gt; After reviewing Gokey\u2019s documents, I asked both the White House and the Department of Education whether the department\u2019s internal legal review was complete, but I didn\u2019t get a specific answer. Nor is it clear whether, if Biden\u2019s lawyers do conclude that he has the authority to cancel a large (or unlimited) amount of student debt, he is willing to use that authority. \u201cThe Department of Education is continuing to work in partnership with colleagues at the Department of Justice and the White House to review options with respect to debt cancellation,\u201d a spokesperson from the Department of Education told me. A White House official told me that the President \u201ccontinues to look into what debt-relief actions can be taken administratively\u201d but that \u201cthese steps take time.\u201d",
