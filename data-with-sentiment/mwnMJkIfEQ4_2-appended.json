Robert Muller ( a democrat ) investigated the Russia thing for months, and could not find a single thing other then Roger Stone making comments to a Russian ambassador that someone like Hillary Clinton also talked too.  I think this is just trying to cover up the 2020 election that was stolen from Trump.   Few Democratic counties that continued to count ballots past the election times.  Like Pennsylvania for example.  The 2020 election ended on that Tuesday, and one Democratic county in Pennsylvania continued to count ballots till Saturday.  That is 4 days past election day.",
