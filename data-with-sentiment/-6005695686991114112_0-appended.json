I do not care about coupons, the only coupon needed has Franklins face. Pay the people a living wage never do coupons and the useful companies will receive enough Franklins. Simple but because of greed we waste huge wattage sending and storing junk mail that saves you 40% on whatever garbage you were never interested in.",
