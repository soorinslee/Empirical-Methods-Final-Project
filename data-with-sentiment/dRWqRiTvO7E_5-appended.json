They actually want to help the country but are attacked on both sides by the corporate puppets in office and corrupt media who profit off the infighting, They don't go after each other as a rule because they don't want people to come after them. National unions are the people's only way forward to bring these criminal corrupt corporations, dark money groups and criminal corrupt politicians to their knees. Use social media as a way to form massive groups to fight for voting rights, livable wages, community funding etc! Because if you don't these criminals will keeps their boots on your necks forever.",

Work is still getting done behind the scenes everyday. Congress has forced Trump to officially try to protect Bannon and thus himself. It shows he is worried. However they will never testify. If brought to trial each will plead the 5th so I wouldn't be on the edge of your seats. This is just an initial investigation and see how the RT has scrambled and cried to derail it. I believe a special prosecutor will be needed eventually. Don't let them discourage us. That is their game.Im not a lawyer though I think it's just Due process. I'm going to Be patient.

The situation boils down to mean any of the following. May be they want more time to act. Or do they have personal bias? Or do they have interests that could prejudice their action, if taken. Are they not unlawfully and unjustifiably favoring Steve Bannon instead of lawfully and justifiably taking action against him, in accordance with the Law of the Land?
