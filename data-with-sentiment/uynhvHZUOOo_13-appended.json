So big cities with a lot of wealth, that are in low lying areas build a massive seawall, then all the water that will have flooded that area has to go somewhere.

We need to find ways to adapt. Even if we stop all fossil fuels today. The planet will still probably warm to 3C or warmer.",

The IPCC has not issued a consensus that all \"climate change\" is man made or that there is evidence of causation through \"carbon dioxide ppm\" compared to correlation because this cannot be proven. Temperature has been at least 2 degrees higher than today only a few thousand years ago...no cars, factories, coal power stations...just the Malinkovitch cycles. Stop believing the world is full of constants because its actually full of variables and this propaganda relies on us believing and not questioning whilst people like Al Gore make huge sums of money from the green con. There's 45 times more carbon in the ocean and as the sun heats it more is released to the atmosphere, when the sun is cooler then more is absorbed by the ocean which is why there is correlation with ice core data temp and carbon dioxide ppm and not causation.",
