However her son will never take her serious and never fear her like he would his father. It all comes down to the fact that fathers are better at discipline, teaching a man how to be a man, and helping his son go through his phases in life. A woman/mother would never understand this. Just as a father would never understand his daughter fully. This is why we as a race were made to have Male and Female. They both compliment each other in different ways.",
