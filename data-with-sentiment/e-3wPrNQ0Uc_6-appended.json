He's taking his risks with the other domineering warmongers that are a little closer to home that can get there sooner.\n\nI'm no military strategist, but it's what I'd do.  If Iran stabilizes Afghanistan, Iran is a world hero.  That nation hasn't been stable since more powerful (greedy) nations discovered resources there, ages ago.  If anyone can do it, it's a local player who knows the field, and what better than one of the oldest players around?  If there be peace coming from Allah, so what?  It's peace!  Deal with it, world!",
