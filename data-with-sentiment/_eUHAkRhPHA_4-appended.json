Guests may need a drink, sometimes in the middle of the night, and not know where to get one or feel awkward asking.  The other is to put your WiFi password in a pretty little frame set out on the bedside table or dresser.  It\u2019s so much fun surprising guests with unexpected niceties.  Great vid as always Lisa!",

I put a flashlight in the drawer and have nightlights if they want they can unplug.  Sound machine and black out curtains.  Your robe idea and dual firmness pillows, is so fabulous, mind blown.  Thanks!  My mom...the last thing she tells her guests before they turn in, is which cabinet to find the chocolate stash is in in the kitchen~so there is that.  : )",
