The finite wealth of the Earth is being used up in increasing amounts as populations grow unchecked. Land which is essential for producing food, is being swallowed up by more people wanting places to live in. Cities are moving out into more and more areas, leaving fewer food producing areas. As a species, we cannot go on breeding uncontrollably for ever. There has to be a point where population control has to be a factor in continuing to maintain the status quo..There is a tipping point, fast approaching, where the planet will be overwhelmed by horde's using up diminishing assets, essential to existence and we will no longer have a World in which we can survive. I wonder what will move into the new environment and be successful? The World will still be here, only not for us",
