            "comment": "Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),\u00a0 and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\"",
