Is it electric?  Does it drain the water well in rain? Does it hold well in wind?  Do you like it?  Your looks short in length; would one fit over your back doors?   \nI appreciate your input particularly since you use your van as a part of your outdoor life.  Thanks.",

If you don't have a skoolie, you really can't have four people in there at the same time.\n Very kool design and use of space !!\nThe up front bed with one or two swivels and/or that single seat ottoman..... make for a nicer cozy gathering place",
