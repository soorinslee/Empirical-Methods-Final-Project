They still look good though but aren't going to look as fashion conscious as that puffer and some relaxed denim with laced boots. I actually was thinking my bomber jacket from All Saints is not as wavy as it once was. I have been rocking my leather biker which one could argue peaked a year or two ago. But I'm also experimenting and just cooped my first pair of Rick Owens pants and shoes. Keep up the good content.",
