My hottest take is that I think it had more to do with the N64's failure than anything else; to me it seems like Nintendo had staked a _lot_ of the console's success on that add-on - just go look at how many of its games, released or cancelled, were originally planned for it - which they then proceeded to barely release and ultimately ignore after just a few months. Talk about self-sabotage, what a mess.",
