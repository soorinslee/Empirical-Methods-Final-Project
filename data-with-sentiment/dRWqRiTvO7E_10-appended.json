The demand means what it says and had a deadline.  No extension.  Produce or action, whether it's by the DOJ or the more direct route.  I guarantee if any of these people were behind bars until they complied, they'd provide everything requested in a New York minute.  If they want to appeal, fine.  But you remain in the slammer until then.  And just remember, the wheels of justice turn slowly no matter which side you're on.
