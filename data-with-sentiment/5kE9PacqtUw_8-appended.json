Instead of telling the nonsense that you are rationalizing for us to our community of ordinary people, can you finally reveal your principals?  We know your plans.  We do not know which barons commission this to you, and above them what the lords of inclusive feudalism are like.  Do you really think we humans are so naive?  Do you think you will go unpunished?  What will happen to you as the principals will abandon you and the citizens will overtake you?",

By means of stop building houses skyscrapers and factories, stop using gasoline and using cars, stop developing machines or technologies. Stop eating and stop everything. But who would do that? Who would care that? Businesses or anyone would never do that. Until there\u2019s human on earth you cannot stop climate change.",

Better for the group, as Mexico's government is actively promoting fossil fuels and the destruction of rain forests. Furthermore, Mexico's government is also actively discouraging investment in renewable energy. So, what can Mexico's clown, I mean president, contribute to the summit other than populist BS?",
