            "comment": "Toilet in kitchen?  \nShe likes winter sports but puts water tank on outside where it can freeze?  \nShower is surrounded by clothes?  The dampness will put mold into the fabric.\nHeavy glass jars rolling around in electrical cabinet?\nPropane tanks - how are they going to be accessed for refills?  Does the propane guy have to crawl under van to refill?  This is truly awful design.\nThe heavy duty toaster oven has zero overhead clearance.  If you operate it inside that cabinet the risk of fire is guaranteed. \n\nDesign of van layout is faulty and not well thought out.  Disappointing.",

I would consider it at $100 but one could buy a year of unlimited access to skillshare or similar  for less than your 50% off price.  I'm not certain your course isn't at the highest ROI, but you've definitely priced it way beyond  my price point.",

If yes, could information be provided where she purchased the jackknife?  \n\nMy son is getting his degree in forestry, and I really want to renovate a van into a camper to visit him while he is doing his internships.  This kind of bed set up would be absolutely perfect!",
