Guests may need a drink, sometimes in the middle of the night, and not know where to get one or feel awkward asking.  The other is to put your WiFi password in a pretty little frame set out on the bedside table or dresser.  It\u2019s so much fun surprising guests with unexpected niceties.  Great vid as always Lisa!",

And PLEASE don't use scents in the air or on the sheets! Idk how many times I've passed by someone on the street wearing colognes or perfume, I immediately cannot breathe! (I also can't go into the laundry or pesticide aisles in the store). The smell of \"Gain\" actually would make it impossible for me to be in that room\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude37",

I can\u2019t wait!!!\nI just created a new guest space for her yesterday. Our 20 yr old daughter decided to move out a couple of months ago. I had a blank white room to start with. \ud83d\ude4c We now call it the upper east wing instead of _____\u2019s room. \ud83d\ude06 No more game room/guest room in this house. \n\nI would add to the list:\n*Charging station\n*Tissues!!! (We live in the allergy belt)\n*Wastebasket(s)\n*Reading nook and/or a desk area with a notebook/journal, post it notes, and a sharpie. I also like to give my favorite pens away. Pilot Frixion\u2665\ufe0f They are erasable GEL pens. They do not need a special shedding eraser. They use friction/heat to erase. They are AWESOME!!!\n*Maybe a small fan and or noise machine -My sister always requests at least one fan. She lives in the north.  We live in beautiful warmer Tulsa. \ud83d\ude0a\n*Clock (I know most of us use our phones, but some like having an easy to see clock in the night and not have to pick up their phone. Maybe a wall clock as art. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) \nOh, and maybe one I\u2019m the bathroom \n\nSpeaking of the bathroom-if it is shared:  \n*counter space\n*drawer space\n*place to hang their towels \n*space in shower for shampoo etc. \n*blow dryer\n*maybe an iron or a small steamer\n*double check to make sure there is enough TP!!!\n*even though it is ugly a plunger is handy. It saves them the embarrassment of asking. We\u2019ve had this happen. \n\nOf course clean it thoroughly and then some!!! Maybe even use it yourself just to see if there is something one can add or remove. \n\nOoooh, I think I need to get a make up mirror for guests. \ud83d\udca1 \ud83e\udd33 \ud83e\ude9e\n\n(My guest share the bathroom with my kid(s) It\u2019s not ideal, but only my family comes to visits.)",
