Back in the 80\u2019s on the river in Cambridge, as the punt in front of us stopped under a bridge, a girl got up from the stern and sang Jerusalem. Phenomenal acoustics. It was a golden moment that still transports me to another world.",

I highly recommend I Was Glad and Blest Pair of Sirens as well. If you can find a version of I Was Glad without the Vivats that's better IMO (the Vivats are usually only performed in the presence of the Monarch!)",
