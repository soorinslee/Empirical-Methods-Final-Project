I understand that it must be really hard to actually get your hamster inside of this challenging obstacle course, but you do it all for our entertainment and I love it very much!! I hope you get 3 billion subscribers!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI love it so much, it\u2019s so cute seeing the curious hamster work their way to find their hamster buddy. And in the end, I know that they are probably rewarded with a good night\u2019s rest and snack time! Have a great day!! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think anyone realizes how much effort you or your team puts into making these incredible hamster mazes!! Like what?? This looks so awesome. \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude31",
