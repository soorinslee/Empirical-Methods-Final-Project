I dont think people who aren't army realise how really talented and skilled they all are. To have become popular worldwide whilst singing mainly at first in Korean is amazing anyway. He has obviously worked hard on his voice to improve it gain techniques etc an it shows. This is one of my favourites to play now more than Harry's even tho I love that too. Thanks for your reaction a new subscribet",
