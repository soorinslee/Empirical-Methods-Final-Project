If you want an ECONOMICAL, versatile wardrobe, you keep your classics, such as turtlenecks and Chelsea boots, and occasionally add items that may be on trend, if it fits YOUR aesthetic. That way, your wardrobe is always fresh. \n\nBuy quality, versatile, staple items,  make sure you get the fit right, and use a little creativity, and not only will you look stylish, you may very well be the best dressed guy in the room! \n\nSometimes bucking the trend, makes you MORE stylish, than all the other followers!",
