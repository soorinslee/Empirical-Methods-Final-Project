            "body": "Hahaha! You really made me laugh in the middle of such serious matters about British food. You are so right - it might look alright via their TV chefs - but in reality in the everyday? it is truly diabolical. That island has become a hornets nest of racism through the Brexit years and more recently via the tsunami of racism in the media and via thousands and thousands of comments about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. There was no intervention by the Queen or other royals to ask that the media should stop it. The Queen has a long history of protecting her own interference in politics and media coverage. She literally does it all the time, even up to COP26. But ne'er a word to defend or protect Meghan, or Harry, who escaped that nasty island, and its nasty food, with their lives. On another serious note, Putin's record is pure evil. And not just with books or stories written about him, those, as you demonstrated, are fairly easily scrubbed from existence. But he murders opponents like Alexei Navalny who is now in a Siberian prison after a miraculous recovery from poisoning by KGB-type agents you would find in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel. He's only alive because of some immediate treatment in Russia before he was flown to Germany for a long recovery. The# list of dead journalists is long. Sometimes death isa meted out in the most brutal of ways by contract killkngs eg: Anna Politkovskaya. Amnesty International has named Russia as the most dangerous country in Europe for journalists. Without journalists telling us what they see and investigate when there's corruption we are all ignorant. This is especially the case when there's corruption and power inequality.",
