When I listen to Adele I want to sing out my heart and my feelings that she waked up in me but with this you didn't wake up any feelings in me until my fav part (I changed who I was to put you both first but now I give up). I had feelings there and I felt that you sing with your heart but just at this part and nowhere else. In singing it was very good, you can sing great and I think I can say that you're a good singer, but I don't know. If you were a good singer, you could sing with your heart. But these are just my thoughts and for someone else you can give feelings because you can sing very well and I can't grab this from you and neither can anyone else. I want you to know that this is a critic from me (who's a no one XD) and I don't want you to think that I attacked you, because I didn't want to do it. Hope you have a good life with a great carrier!",
