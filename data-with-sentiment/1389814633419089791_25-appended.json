When I was in high school I was considered bubbly and very confident, and it was 100% fake. On the inside I was super shy, introverted, and thought all the bad things about myself, and I probably would have stayed that way were it not for the fateful day I ditched school and missed the city bus back home. I ended up talking to some old woman about all sorts of things (I was about 14) and one of the things that stuck with me was the \u201cFake it till you make it\u201d thing. \n\nAt home and in privacy I worked on myself, because like you I was super sensitive. The wrong look and BAM tears. I hated it so much. So at home without anyone looking at me, or making fun at me, I could just work on my self esteem and anything else I wanted to improve. \n\nIn the real world I had to fake it. I didn\u2019t want to be miserable shy mess in public, so I pretended to be so much more put together than I was. \n\nIt worked. \n\nIt took a long time but eventually the faking of confidence showed me things I could only see by putting my shyness and low self esteem aside. Eventually the confidence stayed. It\u2019s about perspective with confidence but again that won\u2019t make sense until it does. \n\nThis is what worked for me in my teenage days, I hope it helps you!

Even the most conventionally attractive people have those who will find something about them to bash on. The important thing to remember is that they have no bearing on the person you actually are. If you are feeling down on yourself in your own right, there are a few things you can do to help build self esteem. First, find things you like to do and do them! You will meet like minded people this way, and having friends who care about you and support you is a big help when considering your mental well-being. You might also get very good at these things, and having a skill l, or something you\u2019re good at, will allow you a sense of pride in the work that you put in. Do things to improve upon yourself. Exercise is a great place to start. It will give you a sense of purpose, an improved mental state, and you may even improve your looks from doing so (this shouldn\u2019t be your sole focus, but it\u2019s a nice side effect. Who doesn\u2019t like to be in shape?). Also, realize that your school aged years are a temporary part of life, and while it can be a very difficult time, as kids can be pretty brutal to one another, it won\u2019t always be this way. Focus on your strengths. You must have things you consider your strengths, so spend more time thinking about them, and focus less on what you perceive as your shortcomings. If you do feel your thoughts drifting towards a negative place, use that as a source of motivation, rather than allowing it to def you down. I hope this advice helps, even a little bit, and I hope that you realize that you are valuable and loved, and even if you don\u2019t think so at times, that you have a very bright life ahead of you, if you allow yourself to it.",
