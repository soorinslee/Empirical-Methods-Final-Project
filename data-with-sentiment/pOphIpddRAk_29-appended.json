Most Nigerian employees have to work in a toxic environment because they don't have the option of quitting. Like who is going to support your family when you quit? Zero government intervention in social amenities, cost of everything is over 200% high, zero regulation on anything,  and nothing is ever coming down. This reality is the reason why Nigerian employers will not even consider this.",
