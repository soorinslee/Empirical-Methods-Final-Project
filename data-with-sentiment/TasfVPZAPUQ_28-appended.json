Mamamoo got nominated for 1 category. I know Mnet is super rigged but RBW, are you sure your \"strategy\" is working? I thought y'all are doing an IPO? Isn't it high time to BOOST brand reputation?",

Otherwise it's back of the line again for them while the groups with big agencies and fanbases takes the cake. No matter how talented our groups are.",
