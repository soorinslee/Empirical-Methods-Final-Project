I forget if he ever mentioned how hot it was, or when this took place. But thinking about it is making me want to visit the book again. And I'd suggest everyone else follow suit if you're even remotely interested in Sci-Fi. Though if you're gonna give Philip K Dick a try for the first time, I'd VERY STRONGLY suggest starting with UBIK. It's an outstanding read. And not too heavy at all.",
