I couldn\u2019t have been more than 20 years of age and I loved it that much that I used it sparingly normally when i was taking a girl out to the city and honestly I mostly wore in winter smelt great off my sweaters.  Not knowing much back in those days did not realize it would expire.  i had it for more than 20 years before throwing the bottle away by that time was shot lol \n\nI may go buy a bottle in a paycheck or two thanks for reminding me how great it is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",
