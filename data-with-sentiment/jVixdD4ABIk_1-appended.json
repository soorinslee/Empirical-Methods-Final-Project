(The main impediment until recently has been mostly poor performances even from the \u201cbest\u201d performers, who often turned the pieces into basically jokes if they could play them competently at all. But players like Mikyung Sung, Luis Cabrera, Wies de Boeve, Theotine Voisin and David Desimpelaere are really upping the quality of double bass performances and revealing the wonderful beauty and lively energy of these works.)\n\n- York Bowen: Viola Sonata No. 1\n\n- J\u00f3zef W\u0142adys\u0142aw Krogulski: Piano Octet\n\n- Dmitry Kabslevsky. I\u2019d heard of Kabalevsky for many years, but never really knew any of his music, and still don\u2019t. We hear all the time about Prokofiev and Shostakovich, but Kabalesky never seems to be mentioned, and rarely played. Yet every bit of his music I\u2019ve ever heard has been consistently, immediately enjoyable.",
