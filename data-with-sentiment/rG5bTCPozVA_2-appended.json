Thanks. \nYou mention chemical anchors almost in passing and I realised you would be the right guy so review some aspect of this space. I took a look over your videos and did not see one yet. \nMy particular problem involves cavity blocks in a gate post. I have electric gates that seem to have worked their bracket bolts loose. However, as many of the fixings are finding cavities I feel I need to tread carefully when fixing this. \nChemical anchors come up as a solution but which product ? And how do I get it right first time as there is likely no attractive second try with this technology. ? \nThanks in advance. \nKeep doing what your do. \nFred.",

For the seals, you can still use rope and a bitumen sealant (used to be lead); the rope makes the whole thing a bit more solid. Hargreaves sell the rope and sealant, I made a tool from 22mm copper pipe to fit it :)",
