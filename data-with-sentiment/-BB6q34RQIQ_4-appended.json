Never in their private lives.    \n\nHow long is the farce going to continue? If we had 100% vaccination rates, they would still demand masks. I\u2019m fully vaccinated and so tired of the games. Biden and Doc F are such jokes and deceivers clearly the majority don\u2019t believe or wear the mask. Doc F said the football season would cause cases to spike, he has been proven wrong again. How many chances do you get at this guessing game?",
