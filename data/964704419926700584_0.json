Between that and surfing...I had something to do...to live for, even if it was just to pluck along and punctuate the time that seemed to dilate in uncomfortable ways during withdrawal and sobriety. The Land of Pleasure was where my mind escaped to when it couldn't take the reality that lay before me.\n\nIt's been half a decade now since I got clean from fent and found balance in my life. I'm happily settled down, more happy than I have ever been.  But I still escape into the world of Sticky Fingers every day. I feel like I owe you all, in a way I can't explain. I guess there is no question here, I just wanted to let you know how incredibly grateful I am for your presence and how proud I am of a band that always soldiers on.

Meaning behind Eddy's song and will you ever play it live because i will fly to saturn to see that happen\n\n2. Any plans to come to North America?

Or is it even something you\u2019ve thought about or do you just take it as it comes? Do you see yourselves continuing to make music together for the foreseeable future or does the idea of more independent projects seem more appealing as you get older and you can use your experience and reach in the industry to have a more personal approach? I personally loved Dizza\u2019s solo tracks and all of the F-pos stuff and wondered if you have all had similar ideas or have any plans? Essentially just want to know what the future of sticky looks like. You lads have been with me through all of my late teens and early 20\u2019s and have helped me through so much and would love to see more from all of you. I\u2019m greedy... sorry haha.
